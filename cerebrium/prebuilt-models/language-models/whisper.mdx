title: "Whisper"
description: "Whisper is a language generation model that receives audio data and performs transcription and or translation, then outputs a text response."
---

Whisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation.
The Whisper model can process audio of any length and takes about 7-10 minutes to process 1 hour of audio. Therefore, this example also demonstrates how you can supply a webhook endpoint that we will send a POST request to, containing your `run_id` and results, once the model has finished running.

We currently have the following whisper model available below however if you would like any others contact support, and we can quickly add it for you.  
To deploy it, you can use the identifier below:

- Whisper Large: `whisper-large`

Once you've deployed a Whisper model, you can supply the endpoint with a base-64 encoded audio file or a file URL. For large files, we recommend you use the file url and webhook endpoint together we will notify your endpoint with the results when the model has finished processing the audio. Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:

#### Request Parameters

<RequestExample>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://run.cerebrium.ai/whisper-large-webhook/predict' \
      --header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "audio": "<BASE_64_STRING>"
        "webhook_endpoint": "<WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT>",
        "file_url": "<FILE_URL>"
        }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  This is the Cerebrium API key used to authenticate your request. You can get
  it from your Cerebrium dashboard.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="audio" type="string" optional>
  A base64 encoded string of the audio file you would like to
  transcribe/translate.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="language" type="string" optional>
  The default here is auto-select however if you would like you can specify the
  language as English (en), French (fr) etc
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="webhook_endpoint" type="string" optional>
  A http endpoint that we can notify with the results of the model once it has
  finished processing.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="file_url" type="string" required>
  A publicly accessible url for us to fetch the file for transcription. This
  does not have to be a S3 url but can be any url.
</ParamField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "text": "<TEXT>",
  "segments": []
}
```

</ResponseExample>

#### Response Parameters

<ResponseField name="text" type="string" required>
  The text that has been transcribed or translated
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="segments" type="string" required>
  Detailed information about the transcription/translation.
</ResponseField>
