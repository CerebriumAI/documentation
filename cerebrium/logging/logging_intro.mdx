# External Monitoring Tools
Cerebrium allows you to log your custom model predictions to external ML monitoring tools. Currently, we support [Censius](https://censius.ai/),
with are planning to add support for [Arize](https://arize.com/) in Q1 2023. If there is a tool you would like to see be integrated into the platform, please contact us!


Adding a monitoring logger to a Conduit object is as simple as calling the `add_logger` method on the object:

```python Deploy a prebuilt Whisper Model
from cerebrium import Conduit, model_type, logging_platform
conduit = Conduit('my-flow', "<API_KEY>", [(model_type.SKLEARN, "my-rf")])
conduit.add_logger(
    platform=logging_platform.CENSIUS, 
    platform_authentication={"api_key": "<CENSIUS_API_KEY>", "tenant_id": "<CENSIUS_TENANT_ID>"},
    features=["feature_1", "feature_2", "feature_3"],
    targets=["target"],
    platform_args,
    log_ms=True
)
```
`platform_args` will be a dictionary of parameters that the specific platform requires.

You can link back to individual predictions made by your deployed conduit using the 
`prediction_ids` field returned by your deployed endpoint after a request. 
This will allow you to see the predictions made by your model in the monitoring tool, or log actuals with the given prediction_id.

You can check out our available integrations below!
