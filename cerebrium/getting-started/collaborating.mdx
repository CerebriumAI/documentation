## Managing Team Members

The Users section in the Cerebrium dashboard provides tools for managing project access and collaboration. From this central location, project administrators can invite team members and control their access levels through role assignments.

## Adding Team Members

To add new members to a project:

1. Navigate to the Users section in the dashboard sidebar
2. Select "Invite New User" in the top right corner
3. Enter the new member's email address
4. Choose their role (Member or Billing)
5. Select "Send Invitation"

The platform sends an email invitation automatically and tracks its status in the Users table.

## Access Roles

Each team member receives a specific role that defines their project access. The Member role enables teams to deploy applications and monitor their performance. For financial management, the Billing role grants additional access to payment settings and usage reporting.

## Managing Access

The Users table displays member details, including names, email addresses, roles, and when they joined the project. From this view, administrators can:

1. Monitor invitation status for pending members
2. Track when members joined the project
3. View current roles and access levels
4. Adjust roles as team needs change
5. Resend invitations when needed

Once members accept their invitations, they gain immediate access based on their assigned roles and can access their authorised project(s) from the dashboards.
