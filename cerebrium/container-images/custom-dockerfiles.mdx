For enhanced flexibility, users can bring existing containerized applications
to Cerebrium. These can range from standard Python applications to
compiled Rust binaries, provided a functional Dockerfile is supplied
to build the application.

There are multiple benefits to building using Dockerfiles on Cerebrium, including
the ability to bring existing containerized apps to the platform and
maintaining consistent deployment environments that are easily managed locally.

## Building Dockerized Python applications

This example demonstrates a simple FastAPI server that has been containerized:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/hello")
def hello():
    return {"message": "Hello Cerebrium!"}

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return "Ok"
```

The application is built using the following Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Python base
FROM python:3.12-bookworm
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install dumb-init
RUN update-ca-certificates

# Copy source
COPY . .

# Install Python deps
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # contains fastapi[standard]

# Runtime
EXPOSE 8192
CMD ["dumb-init", "--", "fastapi", "run", "main.py", "--port", "8192"]
```

This is a standard Dockerfile with a CMD clause that specifies how
to run the container. Use this Dockerfile in Cerebrium by referencing
it directly in the configuration file.

Update cerebrium.toml to include a custom runtime section with the `dockerfile_path` parameter:

```toml
[cerebrium.runtime.custom]
port = 8192
healthcheck_endpoint = "/health"
dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
```

The configuration requires three key parameters:

- `port`: The port the server listens on.
- `healthcheck_endpoint`: The endpoint used to confirm server health. If unspecified, defaults to a TCP ping on the configured port.
- `dockerfile_path`: The relative path to the Dockerfile used to build the application.

If a Dockerfile does not contain a `CMD` clause, specifying the `entrypoint` parameter in the `cerebrium.toml` file is required:

```toml
[cerebrium.runtime.custom]
entrypoint = ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8192"]
...
```

<Warning>
  When specifying a dockerfile_path, all dependencies and necessary commands
  should be installed and executed within the Dockerfile. Dependencies listed
  under `cerebrium.dependencies.*`, as well as
  `cerebrium.deployment.shell_commands` and
  `cerebrium.deployment.pre_build_commands`, will be ignored.
</Warning>

## Building Generic Dockerized applications

Cerebrium supports applications in languages other than Python, provided
a Dockerfile is supplied. The following example demonstrates a Rust-based
API server using the Axum framework:

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::{get, post},
    Json, Router,
};
use serde_json::json;

async fn hello() -> Json<serde_json::Value> {
    Json(json!({ "message": "Hello Cerebrium!" }))
}

async fn health() -> &'static str {
    "Ok"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/hello", post(hello))
        .route("/health", get(health));
    tracing::info!("Listening on port 8192");

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8192").await.unwrap();
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}
```

In this case, a multi-stage Dockerfile is used to seperate the build step, creating a smaller and more secure image for the runtime:

```dockerfile
# Rust base
FROM rust:bookworm as build
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install dumb-init
RUN update-ca-certificates

# Shell project
RUN USER=root cargo new --bin rs_server
WORKDIR /rs_server

# Copy over manifests
COPY Cargo.lock ./Cargo.lock
COPY Cargo.toml ./Cargo.toml

# This build step will cache dependencies
RUN cargo build --release
RUN rm src/*.rs

# Copy source
COPY src/* src/

# Build for release
RUN rm ./target/release/deps/rs_server*
RUN cargo build --release


# Runtime Stage
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=build  /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
COPY --from=build /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1
COPY --from=build /rs_server/target/release/rs_server /rs_server
COPY --from=build /usr/bin/dumb-init /usr/bin/dumb-init
EXPOSE 8192
CMD ["dumb-init", "--", "/rs_server"]
```

Similarly to the FastAPI webserver, the application should be configured in the `cerebrium.toml` file:

```toml
[cerebrium.runtime.custom]
port = 8192
healthcheck_endpoint = "/health"
dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
```
