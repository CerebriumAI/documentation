After deploying your model, it goes through a build process before it reaches a state where it can serve predictions. During this build process, your model can be in one of several build statuses that indicate its current state:

- **Building**: This status indicates that your model's build process is ongoing. It implies that your model's code is being prepared and set up.

- **Build Failure**: This status signifies that an error occurred during the build process of your model. The details of this error can be viewed in the logs.

- **Initializing**: Your model is currently in the initialization phase. It is being set up to start serving predictions.

- **Init Failure**: This status means that an error occurred during the initialization phase of your model. Initialization refers to the setup process before your model starts serving predictions.

- **Success**: This status indicates that your model's build process completed successfully. Your model is now ready to serve predictions.

<Note>
    Build Statues are related to but not the same as Model Statues. Build Statuses indicate the state of your model's
    deployment during the deployment process. Model Statuses indicate the state of your model's deployment after the
    deployment process is complete.
    For more information on Model Statuses, refer to the <a href="/cerebrium/cortex/model-status">Model Status</a> page.
</Note>

Understanding these build statuses can help you troubleshoot issues and manage your model more effectively.

To view these build statuses, navigate to the 'Builds' tab after clicking on the model in the Cerebrium dashboard.

<Note>
    If you encounter 'Build Failure' or 'Init Failure' statuses, inspect the corresponding logs for detailed error
    messages to troubleshoot.
    However, if you're unable to resolve the issue or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us on Slack,
