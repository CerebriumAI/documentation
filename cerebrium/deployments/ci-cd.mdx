If you would like to automatically deploy a new version of your model to production/development once you have merged into the
respective branch you can do so using the commands below. We will be using a Github actions workflow.

### 1. Get your Cerebrium OAuth credentials

Cerebrium stores your credentials in the directory ~/.cerebrium/config. If you run the command 'cat ~/.cerebrium/config' then
you should see an output of 3 variables, namely:
- accessToken
- refreshToken
- projectId

We will need these in the next step

### 2. Define secrets in your github enviornment

Go to your Github respository -> Settings -> Enviorenments

![Github](/images/githubActions.png)


You shoud create a new environment with a title of your choice (prod and dev). Within these environments you have two types
of variables you can work with:
- Environment secrets: These are encrypted and do not show in your workflows logs
- Environment variables: These are not encrypted and so will show in the workflow logs.

In our use case we will store all our variables (accessToken, refreshToken, projectId) as secrets to keep the values hidden

### 3. Github Actions Workflow

In this flow, we do the following:
1. Install a python version of our choice (3.8 to 3.11)
2. Pip install the cerebrium package
3. Login to Cerebrium using our credentials
4. Deploy our model
5. Notify a Slack channel of successful deployment
