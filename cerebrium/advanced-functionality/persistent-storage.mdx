title: "Persistent Cache Storage in Custom and Conduit deployments"
---
Cerebrium caches your models in a specific directory on the server. This cache
persists across your project, meaning that if you deploy a new model with the same
name or use the same HuggingFace model, it will be loaded from the cache rather than downloaded from the cloud. This allows 
us to scale your model deployments to handle more requests quickly, as well as reducing the
size of your deployment container images. Currently, the cache can be accessed through `/persistent-storage` in your container instance,
should you wish to access it directly and store other artefacts. While you have full access to this drive, we recommend that you only 
store files in directories other than `/persistent-storage/cache`, as this and its subdirectories are used by Cerebrium to store your models.

In the future we will charge per GB of persistent storage used, but for now it is free while 
we are in active development. We will also be implementing a way to clear the cache in the future, as well as pre-uploading
models to the cache before deployment.
