title: "Understanding Model Status"
description: "Know your model's current state for efficient deployment and management"
---

Your Cortex model can be in one of several states at any given time. These states are used to indicate the current status of your model and its deployment.

Here's what each state represents:

- Active: The model is successfully deployed and available for use. If your model is sourced from a pre-built setup, it will immediately be in the active state.

- Deleted: This status signifies that there is no deployment associated with the model, which usually means the model has been removed.

- Deploying: The model is currently in the process of being deployed. During this state, your model is not available for use.

- Starting: This is the initial state when the model deployment is underway, but none of the replicas are ready yet.

- Cold: This state indicates that while a deployment exists, none of the model's replicas are ready to serve predictions.

- Unknown: This state is assigned when the model's status cannot be determined, which could be due to an issue with retrieving deployment details.

<Note>
    Remember, the deployment and startup time is proportional to the model size (including dependencies). For
    lightning-fast deployments, start-ups, and scale-ups, keep your model as small as possible!

When you navigate to your Cerebrium dashboard and click on the Models tab, you will be able to see all of your model statuses.
