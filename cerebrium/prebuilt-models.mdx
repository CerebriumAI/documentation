description: "Deploy prebuilt models to an API."

Cerebrium provides prebuilt models that you can deploy to an API. You can use these models to get started with Cerebrium easily.

## Prebuilt Models
### Image Models
#### Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a image generation model that can receive either text or image input and output network-generated images! 
We currently have Stable Diffusion v1.5 available, but are working on supporting other checkpoints:

- Stable Diffusion v1.5 Text2Image: `stable-diffusion-text`
- Stable Diffusion v1.5 Image2Image: `stable-diffusion-image`

You should supply this endpoint with the following data once deployed:


### Language Models
#### Whisper
Whisper is a language generation model that receives audio data and performs transcription and or translation, then outputs a text response.
We currently have the following whisper models available:

- Whisper Tiny: `whisper-tiny`
- Whisper Base: `whisper-base`
- Whisper Medium: `whisper-medium`
- Whisper Large: `whisper-large`

You should supply this endpoint with the following data once deployed:

## Deployment
Deploying a prebuilt model is largely similar to deploying a custom model. The only difference is that you do not need to upload a model file.
Instead, you specify which prebuilt model you want to deploy using the corresponding identifer.

```python
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type
endpoint = deploy((model_type.PREBUILT, "stable-diffusion-text"), 'my-pipeline', "<API_KEY>")
```
<Note>
    You can not use prebuilt models in ensembles or with post-processing functions. They should be contained within single model pipelines only.
