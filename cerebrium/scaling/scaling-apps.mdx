Cerebrium's scaling system automatically manages computing resources to match app demand. The system handles everything from a few simple requests, to the processing of multiple requests simultaneously, while optimizing for both performance and cost.

## How Autoscaling Works

The scaling system monitors two key metrics to make scaling decisions:

The **number of requests** currently waiting for processing in the queue indicates immediate demand. Additionally, the system tracks **how long each request has waited in the queue**. When either of these metrics exceeds their thresholds, new instances start within 3 seconds to handle the increased load.

<Info>
  Scaling is also configurable based on the expected traffic of an application.
  See below for more information.
</Info>

As traffic decreases, instances enter a cooldown period after processing their last request. When no new requests arrive during cooldown, instances terminate to optimize resource usage. This automatic cycle ensures apps remain responsive while managing costs effectively.

## Scaling Configuration

The `cerebrium.toml` file controls scaling behavior through several key parameters:

```toml
[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0           # Minimum running instances
max_replicas = 3           # Maximum concurrent instances
cooldown = 60              # Cooldown period in seconds
replica_concurrency = 1    # The maximum number of requests each replica of an app can accept
```

### Minimum Instances

The `min_replicas` parameter defines how many instances remain active at all times. Setting this to 1 or higher maintains warm instances ready for immediate response, eliminating cold starts but increasing costs. This configuration suits apps that require consistent response times or need to meet specific SLA requirements.

### Maximum Instances

The `max_replicas` parameter sets an upper limit on concurrent instances, controlling costs and protecting backend systems. When traffic increases, new instances start automatically up to this configured maximum.

### Cooldown Period

After processing a request, instances remain available for the duration specified by `cooldown`. Each new request resets this timer. A longer cooldown period helps handle bursty traffic patterns but increases instance running time and cost.

### Replica Concurrency

The number of requests an app instance can handle concurrently is dictated by the `replica_concurrency` parameter. This is a hard limit, and an individual replica will
not accept more than this limit at a time. By default, once this concurrency limit is reached on an instance and there are still requests to be processed in-flight,
the system will scale out by the number of new instances required to fulfil the in-flight requests. For example, if `replica_concurrency=1` and there are
_3_ requests in flight with no replicas currently available, Cerebrium will scale out 3 instances of the application to meet that demand.

<Info>
  Typically most GPU applications will require that `replica_concurrency` is set
  to **1**. If the workload requires GPU but higher throughput is desired,
  `replica_concurrency` may be increased so long as access to GPU resources is
  controlled within the application through batching.
</Info>

## Processing Multiple Requests

Apps can process multiple requests simultaneously using Cerebrium's batching and concurrency features. The system offers native support for frameworks with built-in batching capabilities and enables custom implementations through the [custom runtime](cerebrium/container-images/defining-container-images#custom-runtimes) feature. For detailed information about handling multiple requests efficiently, see our [Batching & Concurrency Guide](/cerebrium/scaling/batching-concurrency).

## Instance Management

Cerebrium ensures reliability through automatic instance health management. The system restarts instances that encounter issues, quickly starts new instances to maintain processing capacity, and monitors instance health continuously.

Apps requiring maximum reliability often combine several scaling features:

```toml
[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 2              # Maintain redundant instances
cooldown = 600                # Extended warm period
max_replicas = 10             # Room for traffic spikes
response_grace_period = 1200   # Clean shutdown time
```

The `response_grace_period` parameter provides time for instances to complete active requests during shutdown. The system first sends a SIGTERM signal, waits for the specified grace period, then issues a SIGKILL command if the instance hasn't stopped.

<Note>
  When using the cortex runtime (default) the SIGTERM signal is captured and the
  app is given a chance to complete requests before being terminated. When using
  a custom runtime, it is the responsibility of the user to handle the SIGTERM
  signal and ensure that the app is given a chance to complete requests before
  being terminated.
</Note>

Performance metrics available through the dashboard help monitor scaling behavior:

- Request processing times
- Active instance count
- Cold start frequency
- Resource usage patterns

The system status and platform-wide metrics remain accessible through our [status page](https://status.cerebrium.ai), where Cerebrium maintains 99.9% uptime.

## Advanced Scaling Configuration

Cerebrium provides a variety of scaling criteria which may be used to scale apps according to different metrics. As mentioned above,
by default this is determined by an application's `replica_concurrency`. However, this strategy may be insufficient for some use cases
and so Cerebrium currently provides four scaling metrics to choose from:

- `concurrency_utilization`
- `requests_per_second`
- `cpu_utilization`
- `memory_utilization`

These can be added to the `cerebrium.scaling` section as such, by specifying one of these metrics and a target:

```toml
[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
cooldown = 600
max_replicas = 10
response_grace_period = 120
replica_concurrency = 1
scaling_metric = "concurrency_utilization"
scaling_target = 100
```

### Concurrency Utilization

`concurrency_utilization` is the default scaling metric, and defaults to a target of _100%_ if not set explicitly.
This scaling metric works by maintaining a maximum percentage of your `replica_concurrency` across every instance of
the app. For example, if an application has `replica_concurrency=1` and `scaling_target=70`, Cerebrium will attempt
to maintain _0.7_ requests per instance across your entire deployed service. This strategy would always ensure an extra
30% capacity is provisioned.

As a different example, say an app has `replica_concurrency=200` and `scaling_target=80`. In this case, Cerebrium will
maintain _160_ requests per instance, and will begin to scale out once that target has exceeded.

### Requests per Second

`requests_per_second` is straightforward criterion which aims to maintain a maximum application throughput
measured in requests per second over every application instance. This can be a more effective scale metric than `concurrency_utilization`
if appropriate performance evaluation has been done on the application to determine the throughput. This criterion
is not recommended for most GPU applications, since this scaling metric does not enforce concurrency limits. For example,
if `scaling_target=5`, Cerebrium will attempt to maintain a 5 requests/s average across all app instances.

### CPU Utilization

`cpu_utilization` uses a maximum CPU percentage utilization averaged over all instances of an application to scale out, relative to the
`cerebrium.hardware.cpu` value. For example, if an application has `cpu=2` and `scaling_target=80`, Cerebrium will attempt
to maintain _80%_ CPU utilization (1.6 CPUs) per instance across your entire deployed service. Since there is no notion of
scaling relative to 0 CPU units, it is required that `min_replicas=1` if using this metric.

### Memory Utilization

`memory_utilization` uses a maximum memory percentage utilization averaged over all instances of an application to scale out, relative to the
`cerebrium.hardware.memory` value. Note this refers to RAM, **not** GPU VRAM utilization. For example, if an application has `memory=10` and `scaling_target=80`, Cerebrium will attempt
to maintain _80%_ Memory utilization (8GB) per instance across your entire deployed service. Since there is no notion of
scaling relative to 0GB of memory, it is required that `min_replicas=1` if using this metric.
