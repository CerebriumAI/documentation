In order to deploy the model you can use the identifier below:

- ESRGAN Upscaler: `esrgan-upscaler`

Real-ESRGAN aims at developing Practical Algorithms for General Image/Video Restoration. The model extends the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data.

You can follow this example of how to call the deployed endpoint:
