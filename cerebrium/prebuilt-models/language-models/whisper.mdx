title: "Whisper"
description: "Whisper is a language generation model that receives audio data and performs transcription and or translation, then outputs a text response."
---

It can process audio of any length and takes about 7-10 minutes to process 1 hour of audio. We also return the timestamps of the transcription if you would like to create subtitles for the audio etc.
We currently have the following whisper models available below however if you would like any others contact support, and we can quickly add it for you. In order to deploy it you can use the identifier below:

- Whisper Large: `whisper-large`

Once you've deployed a Whisper model, you can supply the endpoint with a base-64 encoded audio file or a file URL. For large files, we recommend you use the file url and webhook endpoint together we will notify your endpoint with the results when the model has finished processing the audio. Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:
