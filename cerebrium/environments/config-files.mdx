title: Using Config Files
description: Using config files to configure Cortex deployments easily and quickly
---

After you've created your Cortex project, you may find that you need more control over your deployment than the default `cerebrium deploy` command provides.
For example, you may want to specify the number of GPUs to use, the amount of memory to use or even the version of Python for your environment.
These settings and more are all configurable using config files.

# Using Config Files

Your config file is a TOML file that you can use to specify the parameters of your cortex deployment.  
This file is used to specify the deployment parameters, build parameters, hardware parameters, scaling parameters and dependencies for your deployment.

## Creating a config file

The fastest and simplest way to create a config file is to run the `cerebrium init` command and specify the directory in which you would like to create the config file.
This command will create a `cerebrium.toml` file in your project root, which you can then edit to suit your needs.

```bash
cerebrium init my-project-dir
```

To see the full list of parameters you can specify in your config file, see the [Config File Overview](#config-file-overview) section.

## Updating from requirements files

### Automatic Integration

If you have an existing **requirements.txt**, **pkglist.txt** or **conda_pkglist.txt**, files in your project, we'll prompt you to automatically integrate these into your config file when you run `cerebrium deploy`.

This way, you can leverage external tools to manage your dependencies and have them automatically integrated into your deployment.  
For example, you can use the following command to generate a `requirements.txt` file from your current environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Manual Integration

If you wish to update your `cerebrium.toml` file manually, you can use the following command:

```bash
cerebrium config update
```

And we'll use any existing `requirements.txt`, `pkglist.txt` or `conda_pkglist.txt` files to update your `cerebrium.toml` file.

Optionally, you can provide manual input to specify most of the parameters in your `cerebrium.toml` file from the command line.
For a full list of parameters you can specify, run the following command:

```bash
cerebrium config update --help
```

## Upgrading legacy yaml config files to cerebrium.toml format

If you have a legacy `config.yaml` file which you would like to convert to the new `cerebrium.toml` format, you can use the following command:

```bash
cerebrium config upgrade-yaml
```

# Config File Overview

## Deployment Parameters

Deployment parameters govern the persistent environment in which your model is deployed.
These parameters are specified under the `cerebrium.deployment` section of your config file.

The available deployment parameters are:
| parameter | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your deployment | string | my-model |
| `python_version` | The Python version available for your runtime | float | 3.10 |
| `include` | Local files to include in the deployment. | string | '[./\*, main.py]' |
| `exclude` | Local Files to exclude from the deployment. | string | '[./.\*, ./__\*]' |

## Build Parameters

Build parameters are used during the build phase of your deployment.
They give you control over how your deployment is built and how it is tested.  
These parameters are specified under the `cerebrium.build` section of your config file.

The available build parameters are:
| parameter | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `predict_data` | The data to use to test your predict function on build. This is the same as the payload in a inference call | string | '\{"prompt": "Here is some example predict data for your cerebrium.toml which will be used to test your predict function on build."\}' |
| `force_rebuild` | Whether to force a rebuild of your deployment, clearing all caches and starting from scratch. | boolean | false |
| `disable_animation` | Whether to disable the animation in the logs. | boolean | false |
| `log_level` | Log level for the build step of your deployment | string | INFO |
| `disable_confirmation` | Whether to disable all CLI confirmations before deploying. Use for CI/CD | boolean | false |

## Hardware Parameters

The hardware parameters section is where you can define the specifications of the machine you would like to use for your deployment. This allows you to tailor your deployment to your specific needs, optimizing for cost or performance as you see fit.  
These parameters are specified under the `cerebrium.hardware` section of your config file.

The available hardware parameters in your config are:
| parameter | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpu` | The GPU you would like to use. | string | AMPERE_A5000 |
| `cpu` | The number of CPU cores to use. | int | 2 |
| `memory` | The amount of Memory to use in GB. | float | 14.5 |
| `gpu_count` | The number of GPUs to specify. | int | 1 |

## Scaling Parameters

This section lets you configure how you would like your deployment to scale.  
You can use these parameters to control the minimum and maximum number of replicas to run, as well as the cooldown period between requests. For example, you could increase your cooldown time or even set a minimum number of replicas to run, increasing availability and avoiding cold starts.  
Or, if you are looking to reduce your costs, you could decrease your cooldown time or set a maximum number of replicas to run, reducing the amount of time your deployment is running.  
These parameters are specified under the `cerebrium.scaling` section of your config file.

The available scaling parameters in your config are:
| parameter | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `min_replicas` | The minimum number of replicas to run at all times. | int | 0 |
| `max_replicas` | The maximum number of replicas to scale to. | int | plan limit |
| `cooldown` | The number of seconds to keep your model warm after each request. It resets after every request ends. | int | 60 |

## Adding Dependencies

The dependencies section of your config file is where you can specify any dependencies you would like to install in your deployment. We support pip, conda and apt dependencies and you can specify each of these in their relevant subsection of the dependencies section.

For each dependency type, you can specify the name of the package you would like to install and the version constraints. If you do not want to specify any version constraints, you can use the `latest` keyword to install the latest version of the package.

If you have an existing **requirements.txt**, **pkglist.txt** or **conda_pkglist.txt**, we'll prompt you to automatically integrate these into your config file when you run `cerebrium deploy`.

### pip

Your pip dependencies are specified under the `cerebrium.dependencies.pip` section of your config file.
An example of a pip dependency is shown below:

```toml
[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
torch = ">=2.0.0"
numpy = "latest"
```

### conda

Similarly, your conda dependencies are specified under the `cerebrium.dependencies.conda` section of your config file.
An example of a conda dependency is shown below:

```toml
[cerebrium.dependencies.conda]
cuda = ">=11.7"
cudatoolkit = "11.7"
```

### apt

Finally, your apt dependencies are specified under the `cerebrium.dependencies.apt` section of your config file.  
These are any package that you would install using `apt-get install` on a Linux machine.
An example of an apt dependency is shown below:

```toml
[cerebrium.dependencies.apt]
"libgl1-mesa-glx" = "latest"
"libglib2.0-0" = "latest"
```

## Config File Example

That was a lot of information!  
Let's see an example of a config file in action.

Below is an example of a config file that takes advantage of all the features we've discussed so far.

```toml

[cerebrium.build]
predict_data = "{\"prompt\": \"Here is some example predict data for your cerebrium.toml which will be used to test your predict function on build.\"}"
force_rebuild = false
disable_animation = false
log_level = "INFO"
disable_confirmation = false

[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "my-model"
python_version = "3.10"
include = "[./*, main.py]"
exclude = "[./.*, ./__*]"

[cerebrium.hardware]
gpu = "AMPERE_A5000"
cpu = 2
memory = 16.0
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
cooldown = 60

[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
torch = ">=2.0.0"

[cerebrium.dependencies.conda]
cuda = ">=11.7"
cudatoolkit = "11.7"

[cerebrium.dependencies.apt]
"libgl1-mesa-glx" = "latest"
"libglib2.0-0" = "latest"

```
