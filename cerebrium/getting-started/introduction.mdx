description: Getting started on the Cerebrium platform
---

Cerebrium is a cloud GPU infrastructure platform that transforms how teams deploy and scale machine learning applications. By handling the complex infrastructure – GPUs, Kubernetes, queues, monitoring, and scaling – Cerebrium lets teams focus on building applications that deliver value.

The platform achieves this through rapid cold starts (Less than 5 seconds), flexible GPU options, automated scaling (1 to 10,000+ requests), and simple deployment processes. With 99.9% uptime and continuous weekly improvements based on user feedback, Cerebrium provides the reliability needed for production ML apps.

## Getting Started

Setting up and deploying an app on Cerebrium takes just a few steps:

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
pip install cerebrium
cerebrium login  # Redirects to your browser for authentication
```

### 2. Initialize a Project

```bash
cerebrium init my-first-app
```

This creates a basic project with `main.py` for app code and `cerebrium.toml` for configuration.

### 3. Deploy an App

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

The app now builds and deploys, typically within a few seconds.

## How It Works

Cerebrium uses containerization to ensure consistent environments and reliable scaling for apps. When code is deployed, Cerebrium packages it with all necessary dependencies into a container image. This image serves as a blueprint for creating instances that handle incoming requests. The system automatically manages scaling, creating new instances when traffic increases and removing them during quiet periods.

For a detailed explanation of how Cerebrium builds and manages container images, see our [Defining Container Images Guide](/cerebrium/container-images/defining-container-images).
