## Installation

The package is available from the public PyPi. Install it using the following
command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade cerebrium
```

You can verify your installation by running `cerebrium --help` in your terminal. If you do not get any output
but you can run `import `cerebrium` in Python, ensure pip is on your path.

If you have trouble installing the package, please [contact](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) the team immediately!

## Login to your Cerebrium account

Run the following command:

```bash
cerebrium login
```

This should open up your web browser to the Cerebrium dashboard. If you have not created an account, please sign up otherwise if you are already logged in it should authenticate automatically
and you should be able to return to your terminal. You should get the following success message.

```
âœ… Logged in successfully
Current project context set to p-12345
```

You will see it prints out your current project - think of this as your working environment. In the top left of your Cerebrium dashboard you can create multiple projects, such as a dev and prod
environment for your app with different apps, secrets etc. You can see your projects using:

```
cerebrium project list
```

and switch your working environment using

```
cerebrium project set p-xxxx
```

Awesome! Let's start creating ML-based applications
