description: Deploy Deepgram speech-to-text services on Cerebrium

<Note>
  Deepgram Partner Service is available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater
</Note>

Cerebrium's partnership with [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/) allows you to easily deploy speech-to-text (STT) services with simplified configuration and independent scaling.

## Configuration

Deepgram services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]` section:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "deepgram"

[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 2
memory = 4
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 1800
replica_concurrency = 10
```

## API Key Configuration

To use Deepgram services, you need to provide your Deepgram API key:

1. Sign up for a Deepgram account at [deepgram.com](https://www.deepgram.com/)
2. Create an API key from your Deepgram dashboard
3. Add the API key to Cerebrium:
   - Navigate to the **Secrets** tab in your Cerebrium dashboard
   - Add your Deepgram API key as either an app-specific or project-wide secret
   - The secret will be automatically available as an environment variable in your deployment

## Scaling and Concurrency

Deepgram services support independent scaling configurations:

- **min_replicas**: Minimum number of instances to maintain (0 for scale-to-zero)
- **max_replicas**: Maximum number of instances that can be created during high load
- **replica_concurrency**: Number of concurrent requests each instance can handle
- **cooldown**: Time in seconds that an instance remains active after processing its last request

Adjust these parameters based on your expected traffic patterns and latency requirements.

## Usage Examples

Deepgram services are particularly useful for voice agent applications. For example, Cerebrium runs Deepgram STT models locally next to LiveKit workers, which reduces latency by approximately 400ms.

For a complete example of using Deepgram in a voice agent application, see the [LiveKit Outbound Agent example](/v4/examples/livekit-outbound-agent).
