## Python Version

By default, Cerebrium configs are [initialized](./initial-setup#config-file-format-and-parameters) to the Python version of your interpreter.
You can edit the Python version you wish to use for your app in the **[cerebrium.deployment]** section of your config.
Note, Cerebrium only supports Python 3.10 through 3.12. Support for 3.13 will follow shortly after its release.

```toml

[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "cerebrium-app"
...
python_version = "3.12"
```

## Docker Base Image

Cerebrium supports the ability to define the base docker image you would like to use. At this stage we support any image from
the following DockerHub repositories:

- `debian` (default: `debian:bookworm-slim`)
- Ubuntu based `nvidia/cuda` (example: `nvidia/cuda:12.6.2-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04`)
- Ubuntu & Debian based `python` (example: `python:3.12-bookworm`)

## Dependencies

Traditionally, when working with Python, you will need access to Apt packages, Pip packages and Conda packages. For a deployment to cerebrium, you can specify all of these in your **cerebrium.toml** file in the following locations:

- **[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]** - This is where you define your Pip packages in the form `module = version_constraints`.
- **[cerebrium.dependencies.conda]** - This is where you can define Conda packages you would like to install if you prefer using it for some libraries over pip. You can use both conda and pip in conjunction.

- **[cerebrium.dependencies.apt]** - This is where you can define Linux apt packages you would like to install.

Here is an example of the dependencies section of a **cerebrium.toml** file:

```toml

[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
transformers = ">=4.35.0"
torch = "2.1.0"
accelerate = "latest"

[cerebrium.dependencies.conda]
cuda = ">=11.7"

[cerebrium.dependencies.apt]
ffmpeg = "latest"
"libopenblas-base" = "latest"
"libomp-dev" = "latest"
```

All the sections above are optional, however, have to contain these file names specifically.

## Shell Commands

Cerebrium gives you the ability to run shell commands - this is for more complicated use cases of cloning repositories, running install scripts etc.
The commands will be run in the context of your Python virtual environment, so you may use tools like `pip` to install dependencies.

<Note>
  Please note that shell commands are run last in the build process which means
  it happens after dependency installation. If you would like to install a pip
  package after some shell commands, then run 'pip install transformers' in your
  shell commands.
</Note>

To run shell commands, you define a list of strings in the [cerebrium.build] section of your **cerebrium.toml**:

```toml

[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "cerebrium-app"
...
shell_commands = [
    "echo 'Hello, World!'",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh",
    "uv venv",
    "uv pip install transformers",
    "export SOME_ENV_VAR=value"
]
```
