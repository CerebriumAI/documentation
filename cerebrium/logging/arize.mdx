# Setup
Sign up for a free account [here](https://app.arize.com/auth/join). 
If you wish, consult the [Arize documentation](https://arize.com/docs/) for more information on how to setup Arize to your liking.
Once you have signed up for Arize, you will need to create a 'space' - you can think of this a a way to organise various models but usually one space per company/client is sufficient. 

Arize handles the following type of models for you to do logging. You can read more about the functionality they provide for each to get a sense of their features and functionality:
- [Binary Classification](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/binary-classification)
- [Multi-class Classification](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/multiclass-classification)
- [Regression](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/regression)
- [Timeseries Forecasting](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/timeseries-forecasting)
- [Ranking](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/ranking)
- [NLP](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/natural-language-processing-nlp)
- [CV](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types/computer-vision-cv)

Logging with Arize is particulary easy with Cerebrium since you just have to define about 8 lines of code and it follows an almost identical pattern to if you are familiar on how to log with Arize.

# Adding a Arize Logger
Once you have instantiated your Conduit object in code (see [here](/cerebrium/test-and-deploy)), you can add a Censius logger to it by calling the `add_logger` method.
The <b>Arize</b> logger requires the following platform specific arguments:
- `api_key`: The unique key of our account which can be found in your Space Settings
- `space_key`: The unique key related to the space you would like to deploy your model. This can be found in your Space Settings.
- `model_type`: The type of <i>Arize</i> model you are using. You can find the different options [here](https://docs.arize.com/arize/model-types)
- `features`: A list of the column names of your different features. Do not include outcome variable names - purely features.
- `metrics_validation`: Optional. The validation metrics you would like to use to determine the performance of your model
- `schema`: This is the schema that Arize requires in order to determine what your predictions, features and embeddings are.  

```python
from cerebrium import Conduit, model_type, logging_platform
from arize.utils.types import ModelTypes, Environments, Schema, Metrics
conduit = Conduit(...)

features=["pregnancies", "glucose", "bloodPressure", "skinThickness","insulin", "bmi", "diabetesPedigree", "age"]
schema = Schema(
    prediction_id_column_name="prediction_id",
    prediction_label_column_name="prediction",
    feature_column_names=features,
    tag_column_names=["pregnancies"]
)

platform_args = {
    "model_type": ModelTypes.BINARY_CLASSIFICATION,
    "schema": schema,
    "space_key": "<YOUR_SPACE_KEY>",
    "api_key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "features": ["pregnancies", "glucose", "bloodPressure", "skinThickness","insulin", "bmi", "diabetesPedigree", "age"],
    "metrics_validation": [Metrics.CLASSIFICATION]
}

conduit.add_logger(
    platform=logging_platform.ARIZE, 
    platform_authentication={"space_key": platform_args['space_key'], "api_key": platform_args['api_key']},
    features=platform_args["features"],
    targets=["outcome"],
    platform_args=platform_args,
    log_ms=True
)
```

You can now deploy your Conduit as normal! Your model will log predictions to Arize every time you call the endpoint.
```
conduit.deploy()
```
