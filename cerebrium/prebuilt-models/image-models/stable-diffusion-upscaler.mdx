title: "Stable Diffusion Upscaler"
description: "A Stable Diffusion Upscaler from Stability AI"
api: "POST https://run.cerebrium.ai/sd-upscaler-webhook/predict"
---

To deploy the model, you can use the identifier below:

- Stable Diffusion Upscaler: `sd-upscaler`

This model was trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model.

<Note>
  Your image must be smaller than 510px x 510px and if not, please add a width
  and height parameter to resize it. It does a 4x upscale so you will get a
  2000x2000px image
</Note>

You can follow this example of how to call the deployed endpoint:

#### Request Parameters

<RequestExample>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://run.cerebrium.ai/sd-upscaler-webhook/predict' \
