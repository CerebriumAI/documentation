title: "Request and Response Logging"
description: "Control request and response logs in your Cerebrium applications"
---

By default, the Cortex runtime logs all requests and responses to your Cerebrium application. These logs can be viewed in your application's dashboard and are useful for debugging and monitoring. However, in some cases, you may want to disable these logs for privacy, security, or performance reasons.

## Controlling Logs

Cerebrium provides two settings that allow you to control logging behavior in the Cortex runtime:

- `DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGS` - When enabled, prevents logging of incoming request data
- `DISABLE_RESPONSE_LOGS` - When enabled, prevents logging of response data from your application

<Note>
  These settings only affect the default Cortex runtime. If you are using a 
  [custom runtime](/cerebrium/container-images/custom-web-servers), you will need to
  handle logging behavior in your own server implementation.
</Note>

## Configuration

These settings can be configured as [secrets](/cerebrium/other-topics/using-secrets) at either the app or project level:

1. Navigate to your project dashboard
2. Go to the "Secrets" section
3. Add one or both of the settings as a key with a value of `true` to disable the corresponding logs

<Info>
  Setting the value to anything other than `true` (or leaving it undefined) will
  keep logging enabled, which is the default behavior.
</Info>

## Use Cases

Some common reasons to disable logs include:

- **Processing sensitive data**: If your application processes personal or sensitive information that shouldn't be stored in logs
- **Performance optimization**: For high-throughput applications where logging adds unnecessary overhead
- **Storage considerations**: To reduce log storage requirements for applications with large request or response payloads

## Example

To disable both request and response logging, add the following secrets to your application:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGS | true |
| DISABLE_RESPONSE_LOGS | true |

<Note>
  Remember that secrets are loaded on container startup. If you update a secret,
  you must restart your app container for the changes to take effect.
