title: Legacy YAML Config
description: Using yaml config files to configure Cortex deployments easily and quickly
---


## Introduction
This document is for users who have been using Cerebrium for a while and are familiar with the legacy YAML config file format. If you are new to Cerebrium, please refer to the [initial setup](./initial-setup) guide.

<Note>
Your legacy YAML config file can be converted to a `toml` config file by answering yes to the prompt when you run `cerebrium deploy` as normal. 
This will create a `cerebrium.toml` file in your project directory which you can then edit as you wish.  
Additionally, all the dependencies in your `pkglist.txt` and `conda_pkglist.txt` files will be added to the `cerebrium.toml` file automatically
</Note>


## Legacy Folder Structure


Cortex supports the use of config YAML files to configure various aspects of your project such as hardware requirements, memory and much more.
Using config files makes it easier to keep track of your Cerebrium deployments, share them and use git versioning to show changes over time.

```
project_name/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── pkglist.txt
├── conda_pkglist.txt
└── config.yaml
```

To deploy your model with a specific config file, you can use the `cerebrium deploy` command with the `--config-file` flag to specify the path to your config file. Otherwise `cerebrium deploy` will use the config.yaml (if there is no `cerebrium.toml`) in the file directory.  
Your config file can be named anything you want and can be placed anywhere on your local machine. However, remember to use the `cerebrium deploy` command in the same directory as your main.py as you would normally.

Deploying your model with a config file is as simple as:

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```


### Config File Format and Parameters

The parameters for your config file are the same as those which you would use as flags for a normal `cerebrium deploy` command. They're tabulated below for your convenience:
