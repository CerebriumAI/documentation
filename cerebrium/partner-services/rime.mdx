description: Deploy Rime text-to-speech services on Cerebrium

<Note>
  Rime Partner Service is available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater
</Note>

Cerebrium's partnership with [Rime](https://www.rime.ai/) allows you to easily deploy text-to-speech (TTS) services with simplified configuration and independent scaling.

## Configuration

Rime services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[cerebrium.runtime.rime]` section:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "rime"

[cerebrium.runtime.rime]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 2
memory = 4
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 1800
replica_concurrency = 10
```

## API Key Configuration

To use Rime services, you need to provide your Rime API key:

1. Sign up for a Rime account
2. Create an API key from your Rime dashboard
3. Add the API key to Cerebrium:
   - Navigate to the **Secrets** tab in your Cerebrium dashboard
   - Add your Rime API key as either an app-specific or project-wide secret
   - The secret will be automatically available as an environment variable in your deployment

## Scaling and Concurrency

Rime services support independent scaling configurations:

- **min_replicas**: Minimum number of instances to maintain (0 for scale-to-zero)
- **max_replicas**: Maximum number of instances that can be created during high load
- **replica_concurrency**: Number of concurrent requests each instance can handle
- **cooldown**: Time in seconds that an instance remains active after processing its last request

Adjust these parameters based on your expected traffic patterns and latency requirements.

## Usage Examples

Rime services are particularly useful for voice agent applications. For example, Cerebrium runs Rime TTS models on the same network as the app next to LiveKit workers, which reduces latency by approximately 400ms.

For a complete example of using voice services in a voice agent application, see the [LiveKit Outbound Agent example](/v4/examples/livekit-outbound-agent).
