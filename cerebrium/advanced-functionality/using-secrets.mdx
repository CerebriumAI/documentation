title: "Using Secrets"
---

You may want to use secrets in your model. It's best to store these as secrets.
Secrets are stored encrypted on our servers and are only decrypted when your model is run.

```python
from common.secrets import Secrets

def predict(item, run_id, logger):
    item = Item(**item)

    logger.info(f"Run ID: {run_id}")

    secrets = Secrets()
    all_secrets = secrets.get_all()
    logger.info("All secrets")
    logger.info(all_secrets)

    my_secret = secrets.get('MyKey')
    logger.info("My secret")
    logger.info(my_secret)

    return {"result": f"Your secret is {my_secret}"}
```

### Saving and Updating Secrets

Secrets are created and updated in your dashboard.
