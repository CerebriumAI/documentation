title: "Persistent Storage"
---

Cerebrium gives you access to persistent volumes to store model weights and files.
This volume persists across your project, meaning that if
you refer to model weights or files created in a different app (but in the same project), you're able to access them.

This allows model weights to be loaded in more efficiently, as well as reduce the size of your App container image.

### How it works

Every Cerebrium Project comes with a 100GB volume by default. This volume is mounted on all applications as `/persistent-storage`.

### Uploading files

To upload files to your persistent volume, you can use the `cerebrium volume cp local_path dest_path` command. This command copies files from your local machine to the specified destination path in the volume. The dest_path is optional; if not provided, the files will be uploaded to the root of the persistent volume.

```bash
Usage: cerebrium volume cp [OPTIONS] LOCAL_PATH REMOTE_PATH (Optional)

  Copy contents to persistent storage.

Options:
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit.

Examples:
  # Copy a single file
  cerebrium volume cp src_file_name.txt # copies to /src_file_name.txt

  cerebrium volume cp src_file_name.txt dest_file_name.txt # copies to /dest_file_name.txt

  # Copy a directory
  cerebrium volume cp dir_name # copies to the root directory
  cerebrium volume cp dir_name sub_folder/ # copies to sub_folder/
```

### Listing files

To list the files in your persistent storage, you can use the cerebrium volume ls [remote_path] command. This command lists all files and directories within the specified remote_path. If no remote_path is provided, it lists the contents of the root directory of the persistent storage.

```bash
Usage: cerebrium volume ls [OPTIONS] REMOTE_PATH (Optional)

  List contents of persistent volume.

Options:
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit.

Examples:
  # List all files in the root directory
  cerebrium volume ls

  # List all files in a specific folder
  cerebrium volume ls sub_folder/
```

### Deleting files

To delete files or directories from your persistent volume, use the cerebrium volume rm remote_path command. This command removes the specified file or directory from the persistent volume. Be careful, as this operation is irreversible.

```bash
Usage: cerebrium volume rm [OPTIONS] REMOTE_PATH

  Remove a file or directory from persistent volume.

Options:
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit.

Examples:
  # Remove a specific file
  cerebrium volume rm /file_name.txt

  # Remove a directory and all its contents
  cerebrium volume rm /sub_folder/
```

### Real world example

```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
cerebrium cp sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth segment-anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
```

As a simple example, suppose you have an external SAM model that you want to use in your custom deployment. You can download it to a cache directory on your persistent volume.
as such:

```python
import os
import torch

file_path = "/persistent-storage/segment-anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth"

# Load the model
model = torch.jit.load(file_path)
... # Continue with your initialization
```

Now, in later inference requests, the model loads from the persistent volume instead of downloading again.
