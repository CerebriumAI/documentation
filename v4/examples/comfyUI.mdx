### Introduction

ComfyUI is a popular no-code interface for building complex stable diffusion workflows. Its ease of use, modular setup, and intuitive flowchart interface have helped the community build an extensive collection of workflows. Several websites offer shared workflows to help you get started:

- https://comfyworkflows.com/
- https://openart.ai/workflows/home‍

While experimenting with ComfyUI workflows is straightforward, guidance on production-scale deployment is limited. This tutorial shows how to use Cerebrium to deploy your pipelines as autoscaling API endpoints with pay-as-you-go compute costs. You can find the full example code [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/tree/master/7-image-and-video/1-comfyui).

### Creating your Comfy UI workflow locally

Create your workflow either locally or using a rented GPU from [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/). First, ensure [ComfyUI is installed](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#installing) in your local environment.

This tutorial uses Stable Diffusion XL and ControlNet to create custom QR codes. If you already have a workflow, skip to "Export ComfyUI Workflow".

1. Let us first create our Cerebrium project with: `cerebrium init 1-comfyui`
2. Inside your project, lets copy the ComfyUI GitHub project: `git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI`
3. Download the following models and install them in the appropriate folders within the ComfyUI folder:
   - SDXL base in models/checkpoints.
   - ControlNet in models/ControlNet.
4. To run ComfyUI locally, run the command: python main.py --force-fp16 on MacOS. Make sure you run this inside the ComfyUI folder you just cloned.
5. A server should be loaded locally at http://127.0.0.1:8188/‍
   ‍

In this view, you should be able to see the default user interface for a ComfyUI workflow. You can use this locally running instance to create your image generation pipeline.

### Export ComfyUI Workflow

In our example GitHub repository, we have a workflow.json file. You can click the “Load” button on the right to load in our workflow. You then should see the workflow populated

![ComfyUI Workflow](/images/examples/comfyui1.png)

Don’t worry about the pre-filled values and prompts, we will edit these values on inference when we run our workflow.

To export this workflow to work with Cerebrium, we need to export this to an API format. In the top right over that hovering box on the right. Click the gear icon (settings). You must then make sure that “Enable dev mode” is selected and then can close the popup.

![Save ComfyUI API format](/images/examples/comfyui2.png)

You should then see that a button appear on the right hover box that reads “Save (API format)”. Use that to save your workflow with the name “workflow_api.json”

### ComfyUI Application

The main code in `main.py` uses the exported ComfyUI API workflow to create an endpoint. The code:

1. Initializes the ComfyUI server
2. Loads the workflow API template
3. Processes inputs (prompts, images) through the `run` function
4. Generates base64-encoded image outputs

Note: Cerebrium runs code outside the `run` function only during initialization, while the `run` function handles all subsequent requests.

We need to alter our workflow_api.json file to have placeholders so that we can replace user values on inference. You can alter the file as follows.

- Replace line 4, the seed input, with: "\{\{seed\}\}"
- Replace line 45, the input text of node 6 with: "\{\{positive_prompt\}\}"
- Replace line 58, the input text of node 7 with: "\{\{negative_prompt\}\}"
- Replace line 108, the image of node 11 with: "\{\{controlnet_image\}\}"

### FastAPI app

In addition to the `main.py` file below (Which runs our fastAPI server and initializes ComfyUI on application start), We created a file that contains utility functions to make it easier to work with ComfyUI. You can find the code for that helper [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/blob/master/7-image-and-video/1-comfyui/helpers.py). Create a file named `helpers.py` and copy the code into there.

```python

### Deploy ComfyUI Application

Before deploying our application, we must first define the deployment configuration, which installs all our dependencies, contains our hardware and scaling configurations, as well as any scripts which must be executed before running our app. The following should be added to our `cerebrium.toml` file:

```
[deployment]
name = "1-comfyui"
python_version = "3.11"
include = ["./*", "main.py", "cerebrium.toml", "workflow.json", "workflow_api.json", "helpers.py", "model.json"]
exclude = ["./example_exclude", "./ComfyUI", "./ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors", "./ComfyUI/models/controlnet/diffusion_pytorch_model.fp16.safetensors"]
shell_commands = ["git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI", "pip install -r ComfyUI/requirements.txt"]

[runtime.custom]
port = 8765
entrypoint = ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8765"]
healthcheck_endpoint = "/health"

[hardware]
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
cpu = 4
memory = 16.0

[scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 30
replica_concurrency = 1
response_grace_period = 900
scaling_metric = "concurrency_utilization"
scaling_target = 100
scaling_buffer = 0

[deps.pip]
uvicorn = "latest"
fastapi = "latest"
requests = "latest"
channels = "latest"
websockets = "latest"
websocket-client = "==1.6.4"
accelerate = "==0.23.0"
opencv-python = "latest"
pydantic = "latest"
pillow = "latest"
safetensors = "latest"
torch = "latest"
torchvision = "latest"
transformers = "latest"
torchsde = "latest"
einops = "latest"
aiohttp = "latest"
pyyaml = "latest"
Pillow = "latest"
scipy = "latest"
tqdm = "latest"
psutil = "latest"
kornia = ">=0.7.1"

[deps.apt]
git = "latest"
```

Finally, running `cerebrium deploy` uploads both the ComfyUI directory and ~10GB of model weights. For slower connections, use our helper file to download model weights directly to the appropriate folders. Create a file called `model.json` with the following contents:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors",
    "path": "models/checkpoints/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors"
  },
  {
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0/resolve/main/diffusion_pytorch_model.fp16.safetensors",
    "path": "models/controlnet/diffusers_xl_canny_full.safetensors"
  }
]
```

This configuration tells the helper function where to download models from and where to save them. Models download only on first deployment, with subsequent deploys checking for existing files.

This is what your file folder structure should look like:

![ComfyUI folder structure](/images/examples/comfyui3.png)

Now you can now deploy your application by running: `cerebrium deploy`

Once your ComfyUI application has been deployed successfully, you should be able to make a request to the endpoint using the following JSON payload:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.aws.us-east-1.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxx/1-comfyui/run' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR TOKEN HERE>' \
--data '{"workflow_values": {
  "positive_prompt": "A top down view of a mountain with large trees and green plants",
  "negative_prompt": "blurry, text, low quality",
  "controlnet_image": "https://cerebrium-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/qr-code.png",
  "seed": 1000
}
}'
```

You will get two responses from the output:

- The base64 encoded image of the outline of your original ControlNet image. This is what it uses as a input in your flow.
- A base64 encoded image of the final result.
