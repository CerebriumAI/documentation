title: "Saving File Output"
---

We provide the ability to temporarily store files on our servers and provide a URL to access them.
This is useful for pipelines that output files or other binary data that is too big to send in a request as a base64 string.
Using the `upload` function, you can upload a file to our servers and get a URL to access them.

```python
from cerebrium import upload
def post_process(data, input_data, files):
    # This example does 1 data point, but you can do multiple if you wish in a loop
    from PIL import Image
    image = Image.fromarray(data[0])
    image.save('output.png')
    url = upload("output.png")
    return url

from cerebrium import Conduit, model_type
conduit = Conduit('<MODEL_NAME>', '<API_KEY>', [('<MODEL_TYPE>', '<MODEL_FILE>', {"post": post_process"})])
conduit.load('./')
conduit.run(data)
conduit.deploy()
```
