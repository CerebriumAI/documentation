using Cerebrium."

## Intro

Cerebrium supports Tensorflow, Keras and TFLite through its support for ONXX - we will convert our model from Tensorflow to ONNX.


ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models. ONNX defines
a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning and deep
learning models - and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models
with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers. 

By the end of this guide you'll have an API endpoint that can handle any scale
of traffic by running inference on serverless CPU's/GPU's.

<Warning>
  Currently, Onnx models only work when built with at least Python 3.7 and less
  than 3.9.13 however, we are working on supporting version 3.10/3.11
</Warning>

### Project set up

Before building you need to set up a Cerebrium account. This is as simple as
starting a new Project in Cerebrium and copying the API key. This will be used
to authenticate all calls for this project.

### Create a project

1. Go to [dashboard.cerebrium.ai](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai)
2. Signup or Login
3. Navigate to the API Keys page
4. You should see an API key with the source "Cerebrium". Click the eye icon to
   display it. It will be in the format: c_api_key-xxx

### Develop model

Now navigate to where your model code is stored. This could be in a notebook or
in a plain `.py` file.

To start you should install the Cerebrium framework running the following
command in your notebook or terminal

```bash
pip install cerebrium
```

Copy and paste our code below. This creates a simple 3 layer Neural
Network that classifies flowers from the Iris dataset into 1 of 3 classes. This code could be replaced by any Tensorflow model. Make sure you have
the required libraries installed.

```bash
pip install tensorflow tf2onnx onnx
```

```bash
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target
encoder =  LabelEncoder()
y1 = encoder.fit_transform(y)
Y = pd.get_dummies(y1).values

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
  ])
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=50, epochs=100)

#Convert to ONNX
import tf2onnx
import onnx

input_signature = [tf.TensorSpec([1, 4], tf.float32, name='x')]
onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(model, input_signature, opset=13)
onnx.save(onnx_model, "model.onnx")
```

In the last 3 lines of code, you will see we:
- Define the input signature of our model. This can be a tf.TensorSpec or a numpy array defining the shape/dtype of the input. Our input for the Iris dataset is a (1,4) array and we called the input variable 'x'.
- Use the [tf2onnx](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx#python-api-reference) library to convert our model to the ONNX format. We define the model we would like to convert, the input signature and the opset. The opset is usually just the latest.
- Save our model to a ```.onnx``` file which is what we will use to deploy to Cerebrium.

This is all you need to deploy your model to Cerebrium! You can then import the `deploy()` function from the Cerebrium framework.

```bash
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type
output_flow = deploy((model_type.ONNX, "model.onnx"),"onnx-tensorflow", "<API_KEY>")
```

Your model is now deployed and ready for inference all in under **10 seconds**!
Navigate to the dashboard and on the Models page you will see your model.

You can run inference using `curl`

```bash
curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \
--header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[<INPUT_DATA>]'
```

Your input data should be a **Dict** of the input variables you defined when you exported the model to Onnx. So make sure your input objects correspond otherwise you will get an error. The response will be:

![Onnx Postman Response](/images/quickstarts/tf-onnx-3.png)

Navigate back to the dashboard and click on the name of the model you just
deployed. You will see an API call was made and the inference time. From your
dashboard you can monitor your model, roll back to previous versions and see
traffic.

With one line of code, your model was deployed in seconds with automatic
versioning, monitoring and the ability to scale based on traffic spikes. Try
deploying your own model now or check out our other frameworks.
