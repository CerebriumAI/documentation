title: TOML Reference
description: Complete reference for all parameters available in Cerebrium's default `cerebrium.toml` configuration file.
---

<Warning>
**Deprecation Notice:** The `cerebrium.` prefix is being removed from all configuration sections. Sub-keys are becoming top-level keys (e.g., `[cerebrium.deployment]` → `[deployment]`). The prefixed format is still supported for backwards compatibility but will be removed in a future release. We recommend migrating to the new format.

| Current (Deprecated)         | New Format          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `[cerebrium.deployment]`     | `[deployment]`      |
| `[cerebrium.runtime.cortex]` | `[runtime.auto-py]` |
| `[cerebrium.hardware]`       | `[hardware]`        |
| `[cerebrium.scaling]`        | `[scaling]`         |
| `[cerebrium.dependencies]`   | `[dependencies]`    |

</Warning>

The configuration is organized into the following main sections:

- **[deployment]** Core settings like app name and file inclusion rules
- **[runtime.auto-py]** Default Cerebrium-managed Python runtime (build settings)
- **[runtime.python]** Custom Python ASGI/WSGI web server settings
- **[runtime.docker]** Custom Dockerfile settings
- **[hardware]** Compute resources including CPU, memory, and GPU specifications
- **[scaling]** Auto-scaling behavior and replica management
- **[dependencies]** Package management for Python (pip), system (apt), and Conda dependencies

## Deployment Configuration

The `[deployment]` section defines core deployment settings that apply to all runtime types.

| Option                            | Type     | Default          | Description                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name                              | string   | required         | Desired app name                                                                                             |
| disable_auth                      | boolean  | false            | Disable default token-based authentication on app endpoints                                                  |
| include                           | string[] | ["*"]            | Files/patterns to include in deployment                                                                      |
| exclude                           | string[] | [".*"]           | Files/patterns to exclude from deployment                                                                    |
| deployment_initialization_timeout | integer  | 600 (10 minutes) | The max time to wait for app initialisation during build before timing out. Value must be between 60 and 830 |

## Runtime Configuration

Cerebrium supports three runtime types. You should only specify one runtime section in your configuration.

### Auto-Py Runtime (Default)

The `[runtime.auto-py]` section configures the default Cerebrium-managed Python runtime. This is ideal for standard Python applications where Cerebrium automatically manages the web server.

| Option                | Type     | Default                | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| python_version        | string   | "3.11"                 | Python version to use (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)      |
| docker_base_image_url | string   | "debian:bookworm-slim" | Base Docker image                             |
| shell_commands        | string[] | []                     | Commands to run at the end of the build       |
| pre_build_commands    | string[] | []                     | Commands to run before dependencies install   |
| use_uv                | boolean  | false                  | Use UV for faster Python package installation |

**Example:**

```toml
[deployment]
name = "my-app"

[runtime.auto-py]
python_version = "3.12"
docker_base_image_url = "debian:bookworm-slim"
use_uv = true
```

<Info>
  Changes to python_version or docker_base_image_url trigger full rebuilds since
  they affect the base environment.
</Info>

### Python Runtime (Custom ASGI/WSGI)

The `[runtime.python]` section configures custom Python ASGI/WSGI web servers. Use this when you need full control over your web server implementation for features like custom authentication, dynamic batching, or WebSocket connections.

| Option                | Type     | Default                                                            | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| python_version        | string   | "3.11"                                                             | Python version to use (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)                               |
| docker_base_image_url | string   | "debian:bookworm-slim"                                             | Base Docker image                                                      |
| shell_commands        | string[] | []                                                                 | Commands to run at the end of the build                                |
| pre_build_commands    | string[] | []                                                                 | Commands to run before dependencies install                            |
| use_uv                | boolean  | false                                                              | Use UV for faster Python package installation                          |
| entrypoint            | string[] | ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"] | Command to start the application                                       |
| port                  | integer  | 8000                                                               | Port the application listens on                                        |
| healthcheck_endpoint  | string   | ""                                                                 | HTTP path for health checks (empty uses TCP). Failure causes restart   |
| readycheck_endpoint   | string   | ""                                                                 | HTTP path for readiness checks (empty uses TCP). Failure stops routing |

**Example:**

```toml
[deployment]
name = "my-fastapi-app"

[runtime.python]
python_version = "3.11"
entrypoint = ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
port = 8000
healthcheck_endpoint = "/health"
readycheck_endpoint = "/ready"

[runtime.python.deps.pip]
fastapi = "latest"
uvicorn = "latest"
```

<Info>
  The port specified in entrypoint must match the port parameter. All endpoints
  will be available at `https://api.aws.us-east-1.cerebrium.ai/v4/{project - id}
  /{app - name}/your/endpoint`
</Info>

### Docker Runtime (Custom Dockerfile)

The `[runtime.docker]` section configures deployments using custom Dockerfiles. Use this for non-Python applications or when you need complete control over the container build process.

| Option               | Type     | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dockerfile_path      | string   | required | Relative path to a custom Dockerfile                                                                                                                       |
| entrypoint           | string[] | []       | Command to start the application. Required if Dockerfile has no CMD/ENTRYPOINT. **Always takes precedence over Dockerfile CMD/ENTRYPOINT when specified.** |
| port                 | integer  | 8000     | Port the application listens on                                                                                                                            |
| healthcheck_endpoint | string   | ""       | HTTP path for health checks (empty uses TCP). Failure causes the instance to restart                                                                       |
| readycheck_endpoint  | string   | ""       | HTTP path for readiness checks (empty uses TCP). Failure ensures the load balancer does not route to the instance                                          |

**Example:**

```toml
[deployment]
name = "my-docker-app"

[runtime.docker]
dockerfile_path = "./Dockerfile"
port = 8080
healthcheck_endpoint = "/health"
readycheck_endpoint = "/ready"
```

<Info>
  **Entrypoint Precedence:** When both `entrypoint` in `cerebrium.toml` and
  `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` in your Dockerfile are defined, the TOML `entrypoint`
  always takes precedence. This allows you to override your Dockerfile's default
  command at deploy time without modifying the Dockerfile itself.
</Info>

<Warning>
  When using `dockerfile_path`, all dependencies and build commands should be
  handled within the Dockerfile. The `[deps.*]` sections, `shell_commands`, and
  `pre_build_commands` will be ignored.
</Warning>

### UV Package Manager

UV is a fast Python package installer written in Rust that can significantly speed up deployment times. When enabled in `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]`, UV will be used instead of pip for installing Python dependencies.

<Info>
UV typically installs packages 10-100x faster than pip, especially beneficial for:

- Large dependency trees
- Multiple packages
- Clean builds without cache

</Info>

**Example with UV enabled:**

```toml
[runtime.auto-py]
use_uv = true
```

### Monitoring UV Usage

Check your build logs for these indicators:

- **UV_PIP_INSTALL_STARTED** - UV is successfully being used
- **PIP_INSTALL_STARTED** - Standard pip installation (when `use_uv` is `false`)

<Warning>
  While UV is compatible with most packages, some edge cases may cause build
  failures, such as legacy packages with non-standard metadata.
</Warning>

### Deploying with UV Lock Files

<Info>read only if you're using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`</Info>

Generate your lock file locally. This creates a uv.lock file with exact dependency versions.

```bash
# In your project directory with pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

Export your locked dependencies to requirements.txt

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
# Or if you want to use the lock file:
uv pip compile uv.lock -o requirements.txt
```

Include in your deployment:

- Ensure requirements.txt is in your project directory
- Deploy with UV enabled

## Hardware Configuration

The `[hardware]` section defines compute resources.

| Option    | Type    | Default     | Description                          |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| cpu       | float   | required    | Number of CPU cores                  |
| memory    | float   | required    | Memory allocation in GB              |
| compute   | string  | "CPU"       | Compute type (CPU, AMPERE_A10, etc.) |
| gpu_count | integer | 0           | Number of GPUs                       |
| provider  | string  | "aws"       | Cloud provider                       |
| region    | string  | "us-east-1" | Deployment region                    |

<Warning>
  Memory refers to RAM, not GPU VRAM. Ensure sufficient memory for your
  workload.
</Warning>

## Scaling Configuration

The `[scaling]` section controls auto-scaling behavior.

| Option                    | Type    | Default                   | CLI Requirement | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

<Warning>
  Setting min_replicas > 0 maintains warm instances for immediate response but
  increases costs.
</Warning>

The `scaling_metric` options are:

- **concurrency_utilization**: Maintains a percentage of your replica_concurrency across instances. For example, with `replica_concurrency=200` and `scaling_target=80`, maintains 160 requests per instance.
- **requests_per_second**: Maintains a specific request rate across all instances. For example, `scaling_target=5` maintains 5 requests/s average across instances.
- **cpu_utilization**: Maintains CPU usage as a percentage of hardware.cpu. For example, with `cpu=2` and `scaling_target=80`, maintains 80% CPU utilization (1.6 CPUs) per instance.
- **memory_utilization**: Maintains RAM usage as a percentage of hardware.memory. For example, with `memory=10` and `scaling_target=80`, maintains 80% memory utilization (8GB) per instance.

<Info>
The scaling_buffer option is only available with concurrency_utilization and requests_per_second metrics.
It ensures extra capacity is maintained above what the scaling metric suggests.

For example, with `min_replicas=0` and `scaling_buffer=3`, the system will maintain 3 replicas as baseline capacity.

</Info>

## Dependencies

Dependencies can be specified either at the runtime level (recommended) or at the top level. Runtime-specific dependencies are the preferred approach as they keep dependencies alongside their runtime configuration.

### Runtime-Specific Dependencies (Recommended)

Dependencies can be specified within the runtime section. This is the recommended approach:

```toml
[runtime.auto-py]
python_version = "3.12"

[runtime.auto-py.deps.pip]
torch = "==2.0.0"      # Exact version
numpy = "latest"       # Latest version
pandas = ">=1.5.0"     # Minimum version

[runtime.auto-py.deps.apt]
ffmpeg = "latest"
libopenblas-base = "latest"

[runtime.auto-py.deps.conda]
cuda = ">=11.7"
cudatoolkit = "11.7"

[runtime.auto-py.deps.paths]
pip = "requirements.txt"  # Alternative: use a file instead of inline
```

This approach works with any runtime type (`auto-py`, `python`, or partner services).

<Warning>
  **Deprecated:** Top-level `[dependencies.*]` and `[deps.*]` sections are
  deprecated. Please move your dependencies to `[runtime.{type}.deps.*]`.
  Dependencies specified at the runtime level take precedence over top-level
  dependencies when both are present.
</Warning>

### Top-Level Dependencies (Deprecated)

<Warning>
  This approach is deprecated. Please migrate to runtime-specific dependencies
  above.
</Warning>

#### Pip Dependencies

The `[dependencies.pip]` section lists Python package requirements.

```toml
[dependencies.pip]
torch = "==2.0.0"      # Exact version
numpy = "latest"       # Latest version
pandas = ">=1.5.0"     # Minimum version
```

#### APT Dependencies

The `[dependencies.apt]` section specifies system packages.

```toml
[dependencies.apt]
ffmpeg = "latest"
libopenblas-base = "latest"
```

#### Conda Dependencies

The `[dependencies.conda]` section manages Conda packages.

```toml
[dependencies.conda]
cuda = ">=11.7"
cudatoolkit = "11.7"
```

#### Dependency Files

The `[dependencies.paths]` section allows using requirement files.

```toml
[dependencies.paths]
pip = "requirements.txt"
apt = "pkglist.txt"
conda = "conda_pkglist.txt"
```

## Backwards Compatibility

<Warning>
  The following configuration patterns are deprecated but still supported for
  backwards compatibility. We recommend migrating to the new format.
</Warning>

### Deprecated: cerebrium.\* prefix

The `cerebrium.` prefix on all section names is deprecated. Please migrate to the new format:

| Deprecated Format            | New Format           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `[cerebrium.deployment]`     | `[deployment]`       |
| `[cerebrium.runtime.cortex]` | `[runtime.auto-py]`  |
| `[cerebrium.runtime.python]` | `[runtime.python]`   |
| `[cerebrium.runtime.docker]` | `[runtime.docker]`   |
| `[cerebrium.hardware]`       | `[hardware]`         |
| `[cerebrium.scaling]`        | `[scaling]`          |
| `[cerebrium.deps.pip]`       | `[dependencies.pip]` |
| `[cerebrium.deps.apt]`       | `[dependencies.apt]` |

### Deprecated: Runtime fields in [deployment]

The following fields in `[deployment]` are deprecated. Please move them to the appropriate runtime section:

| Deprecated Field      | New Location                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| python_version        | `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]` |
| docker_base_image_url | `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]` |
| shell_commands        | `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]` |
| pre_build_commands    | `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]` |
| use_uv                | `[runtime.auto-py]` or `[runtime.python]` |

### Deprecated: [runtime.custom]

The `[runtime.custom]` section is deprecated. Please migrate to:

- `[runtime.python]` - For custom Python ASGI/WSGI applications
- `[runtime.docker]` - For custom Dockerfile deployments (when using `dockerfile_path`)

### Deprecated: Runtime names `cortex` and `python`

The runtime names `cortex` and `python` are deprecated. The old names still work for backwards compatibility but will be removed in a future release.

| Deprecated Name    | New Name            |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `[runtime.cortex]` | `[runtime.auto-py]` |

### Deprecated: Top-level [dependencies.*]

Top-level dependency sections are deprecated. Please move dependencies to runtime-specific sections:

| Deprecated Location    | New Location                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `[dependencies.pip]`   | `[runtime.{type}.deps.pip]`   |
| `[dependencies.apt]`   | `[runtime.{type}.deps.apt]`   |
| `[dependencies.conda]` | `[runtime.{type}.deps.conda]` |
| `[dependencies.paths]` | `[runtime.{type}.deps.paths]` |

Where `{type}` is your runtime type (e.g., `auto-py`, `python`).

<Info>
  When both top-level and runtime-specific dependencies are present,
  runtime-specific dependencies take precedence on a per-package basis. This
  allows gradual migration.
