description: Deploy specialized services from Cerebrium's partners with simplified configurations
---

<Note>Partner Services are available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater</Note>

Cerebrium offers specialized services in partnership with leading AI companies. These Partner Services feature simplified configurations, independent scaling, and quick deployment.

Currently, Cerebrium offers the following Partner Services:
- Deepgram - Speech-to-text (STT) services
- Rime - Text-to-speech (TTS) services

## Benefits of Partner Services

Partner Services provide several advantages:

- Simplified configuration with specialized TOML sections
- Independent scaling of each service
- Quick and easy deployment
- Reduced latency by running models locally

## Deepgram

Deepgram provides high-quality speech-to-text services that can be easily deployed on Cerebrium.

### Configuration

Deepgram services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]` section:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "deepgram"

[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 2
memory = 4
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 1800
```

## Rime

Rime provides high-quality text-to-speech services that can be easily deployed on Cerebrium.

### Configuration

Rime services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[cerebrium.runtime.rime]` section:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "rime"

[cerebrium.runtime.rime]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 2
memory = 4
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 1800
```

## Deployment

To deploy a Partner Service, create a TOML file with the appropriate configuration and deploy it using the Cerebrium CLI:

```bash
cerebrium deploy -f your-config.toml
```

## Usage Examples

Partner Services can be used in various applications, particularly for voice agents. For example, Cerebrium has partnerships with both Deepgram and Rime to run their STT and TTS models locally next to LiveKit workers, which reduces latency by approximately 400ms.

For more information on using these services in voice agent applications, see the [LiveKit Outbound Agent example](/v4/examples/livekit-outbound-agent).
