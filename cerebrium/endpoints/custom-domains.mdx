description: "Connect your own domain to your Cerebrium project"

Custom domains allow you to serve your Cerebrium apps through your own domain instead of the default `*.cerebrium.ai` URLs.
Once configured, your API calls will use your custom domain while keeping the same path structure: `api.yourdomain.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run`.

## Key Features

- Support for apex domains (`yourdomain.com`) and subdomains (`api.yourdomain.com`)
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal
- Project-level domains - one domain serves all apps in your project
- Multiple domains can point to the same project
- Professional branding with your own domain instead of `*.cerebrium.ai` URLs

## How Custom Domains Work

- **Domains are region-specific** meaning each will always resolve to the selected region
- **Domains are app-agnostic** so you can use connect to any number of deployed apps within your project via custom domain
- **Multiple domains** can be configured on the same project (useful if you have apps within the project deployed in different regions)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Custom Domain

1. Navigate to your project settings in the Cerebrium dashboard
2. Click on the "Custom Domains" tab
3. Click "Add Custom Domain"
4. Enter your domain name and select your target region (choose the region closest to your users for optimal latency)
5. Click "Create Domain"

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records

After creating the domain, you'll receive DNS configuration instructions. Copy these and create a CNAME record in your DNS provider using the DNS record Cerebrium generates for you.

<Note>
  You can also find your DNS record details later by clicking "DNS Record" in
  the Custom Domains list.
</Note>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subdomains (Recommended)">
    **Benefits:**
    - Easier DNS configuration
    - Allows other subdomains for different purposes

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: api
    Value: proxy.aws.{region}.cerebrium.ai
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apex Domains">
    **Benefits:**
    - Routes all traffic from your domain root
    - Best for dedicated API domains

    **Note:** ALIAS records are preferred over CNAME since only one CNAME is allowed per domain

    ```
    Type: CNAME (or ALIAS if supported)
    Name: @ (or leave blank)
    Value: proxy.aws.{region}.cerebrium.ai
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
  You will be prompted to select a `{region}` when creating your custom domain.
</Note>

### Step 3: Domain Validation

1. After configuring DNS, return to the Cerebrium dashboard
2. Cerebrium will automatically attempt to validate your DNS records every 30 minutes for up to 2 days
3. To trigger an immediate validation attempt, click "Validate Domain" next to your domain, even after the 2 days have elapsed
4. If validation fails, the dialog will show you the last known error.
5. Once validated, SSL certificates will be automatically provisioned

### Step 4: Start Using Your Custom Domain

Once validation is complete, you can immediately start using your custom domain with all apps in your project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="POST Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{'inputs': {'prompt': 'Hello world'}}"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GET Request">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.yourdomain.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Your Domains

### Domain Validation Statuses

Cerebrium will attempt to validate your domain once every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 2 days. If your domain is not
being validated, you can click on "Validation Status" to see the last validation attempt, along with any error that
occurred.

- **Pending**: Domain is waiting for DNS validation
- **Validated**: Domain is successfully validated and ready to use
- **Failed**: DNS validation failed - click "Validation Status" to see the specific error

### Validation Errors

If your domain shows "Failed" status it means that the DNS record has been misconfigured, common issues include:

- **Wrong target**: CNAME points to incorrect proxy URL
- **Multiple conflicting records**: Remove any existing ALIAS records for the same hostname

### Common DNS Provider Issues

- **Cloudflare**: Disable proxy (set to "DNS only" - gray cloud icon)
- **Route53**: Use simple routing policy, not weighted or latency-based
- **Namecheap**: Use "@" for apex domains, not "www" or blank
- **GoDaddy**: CNAME records cannot be used with apex domains - consider using a subdomain or an ALIAS record

### Common DNS Mistakes

- **Wrong proxy URL**: Ensure you're using the exact URL provided in the dashboard
- **TTL too high**: Consider lowering TTL before making DNS changes
- **Multiple records**: Remove conflicting A or CNAME records for the same name

## Security Considerations

- Custom domains automatically receive SSL certificates
- All traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- Certificates auto-renew before expiration
- Domain validation ensures you control the domain
