title: "Rest API"

By default, all deployments on Cerebrium are a REST API that are accessible through an authenticated POST request. Authentication is done using your JWT token from
your API Keys section on your dashboard.

Typically, a POST requests take the form below where the final word is the name of your function you would like to call. ie: in this case, the function in our main.py we are calling is predict()

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://run.cerebrium.ai/v3/p-xxxxx/test-model/predict' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "prompt": "Hello world!"
}'
```

Responses then take the form:

```bash
{
    "run_id": "52eda406-b81b-43f5-8deb-fcf80dfsb74b",
    "message": "Your input said: Hello World!",
    "runtime: 326.34
}
```

All responses, if successful, will return a 200 on success and a 500 on error. If you would like to return custom status codes based on certain functionality
such as 422, 404 etc, return the json parameter **status_code** from your \*main.py\*\*.
