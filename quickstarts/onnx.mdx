## Intro

ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models. ONNX defines
a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning and deep
learning models - and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models
with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

By the end of this guide you'll have an API endpoint that can handle any scale
of traffic by running inference on serverless CPU's/GPU's.

<Warning>
  Currently, Onnx models only work when built with at least Python 3.7 and less
  than 3.9.13 however, we are working on supporting version 3.10/3.11
</Warning>

### Project set up

Before building you need to set up a Cerebrium account. This is as simple as
starting a new Project in Cerebrium and copying the API key. This will be used
to authenticate all calls for this project.

### Create a project

1. Go to [dashboard.cerebrium.ai](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai)
2. Signup or Login
3. Navigate to Settings page
4. Navigate to the API Keys tab
5. You should see an API key with the source "Cerebrium". Click the eye icon to
   display it. It will be in the format: c_api_key-xxx

### Develop model

Now navigate to where your model code is stored. This could be in a notebook or
in a plain `.py` file.

To start you should install the Cerebrium framework running the following
command in your notebook or terminal

```bash
pip install cerebrium
```

Copy and paste our code below. This creates a simple Convolutional Neural
Network. This code could be replaced by any Pytorch model. Make sure you have
the required libraries installed.

```bash
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

batch_size = 64
num_classes = 10
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 2

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Use transforms.compose method to reformat images for modeling,
# and save to variable all_transforms for later use
all_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize((32,32)),
                                     transforms.ToTensor(),
                                     transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465],
                                                          std=[0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010])
                                     ])
# Create Training dataset
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root = './data',
                                             train = True,
                                             transform = all_transforms,
                                             download = True)

# Create Testing dataset
test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root = './data',
                                            train = False,
                                            transform = all_transforms,
                                            download=True)

# Instantiate loader objects to facilitate processing
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset = train_dataset,
                                           batch_size = batch_size,
                                           shuffle = True)

test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset = test_dataset,
                                           batch_size = batch_size,
                                           shuffle = True)

# Create Neural Network
class ConvNeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(ConvNeuralNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv_layer1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3)
        self.conv_layer2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3)
        self.max_pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size = 2, stride = 2)

        self.conv_layer3 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3)
        self.conv_layer4 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=64, kernel_size=3)
        self.max_pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size = 2, stride = 2)

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1600, 128)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.conv_layer1(x)
        out = self.conv_layer2(out)
        out = self.max_pool1(out)

        out = self.conv_layer3(out)
        out = self.conv_layer4(out)
        out = self.max_pool2(out)

        out = out.reshape(out.size(0), -1)

        out = self.fc1(out)
        out = self.relu1(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

model = ConvNeuralNet(num_classes)

# Create loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, weight_decay = 0.005, momentum = 0.9)

total_step = len(train_loader)

# Train our model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)

        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print('Epoch [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}'.format(epoch+1, num_epochs, loss.item()))

with torch.no_grad():
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

    print('Accuracy of the network on the {} train images: {} %'.format(50000, 100 * correct / total))

# convert to onnx
input_names = ["input"]
output_names = ["output"]
torch.onnx.export(
    model,
    images,
    "pytorch.onnx",
    verbose=True,
    input_names=input_names,
    output_names=output_names,
)
```

In the last line of code, you will see we exported the Pytorch model to an Onnx
format. This is all you need to deploy your model to Cerebrium! You can then import the `deploy()` function from the Cerebrium framework. I used the CloudPickle function to save my model below.

```bash
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type
output_flow = deploy((model_type.ONNX, "pytorch.onnx"),"onnx-pytorch", "<API_KEY>")
```

Your model is now deployed and ready for inference all in under **10 seconds**!
Navigate to the dashboard and on the Models page you will see your model.

You can run inference using `curl`

```bash
curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \
--header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{"input": [<DATA>]}'
```

You will see we have to specify our data as a **Dict**. Our Dict has the name
"input". This is what we specified when we exported our Onnx model, so you have
to make sure our input objects correspond. The response will be:

![Onnx Postman Response](/images/quickstarts/onnx-3.png)

Navigate back to the dashboard and click on the name of the model you just
deployed. You will see an API call was made and the inference time. From your
dashboard you can monitor your model, roll back to previous versions and see
traffic.

![XGB Monitoring](/images/quickstarts/onnx-4.png)

With one line of code, your model was deployed in seconds with automatic
versioning, monitoring and the ability to scale based on traffic spikes. Try
deploying your own model now or check out our other frameworks.
