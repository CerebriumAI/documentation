description: Deploy Rime text-to-speech services on Cerebrium
---

<Note>
  Rime Partner Service is available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater
</Note>

Cerebrium's partnership with [Rime](https://www.rime.ai/) helps teams deliver text-to-speech (TTS) services with efficient deployment, minimized latency, and region selection for data privacy compliance needs.

## Setup

1. Create a Rime account and get an API key.
   In order to use Rime on Cerebrium, you will need to create a [Rime](https://www.rime.ai/) account and get an API key. You must then create a <b>secret in Cerebrium</b> with the specific name <b>"RIME_API_KEY".</b>

2. Create a simple cerebrium app with the CLI:

```bash
cerebrium init rime
```

3. Rime services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[runtime.rime]` section. Create a `cerebrium.toml` file with the following:

```toml
[deployment]
name = "rime"
disable_auth = true

[runtime.rime]
port = 8001

[hardware]
cpu = 4
memory = 30
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1
region = "us-east-1"

[scaling]
min_replicas = 1
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 120
replica_concurrency = 50
```

<Note>
  You need to disable auth in the above since you need to use your Rime API key
  in the header. API authentication is handle by the Rime Server using your API
  key
</Note>

4. Run `cerebrium deploy` to deploy the Rime service - the output of which should appear as follows:

```
App Dashboard: https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai/projects/p-xxxxxxxx/apps/p-xxxxxxxx-rime
```

5. Use the Deployment url from the output to send requests to the <b>HTTP</b> Rime service via curl request:

```
curl --location 'https://api.aws.us-east-1.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxxxxx/rime' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <RIME_API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: audio/pcm' \
--data '{
  "text": "I would love to have a conversation with you.",
  "speaker": "joy",
  "modelId": "mist"
}'
```

For <b>Websockets</b>, send the following

```
wss://api.aws.us-east-1.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxxx/rime/ws2?audioFormat=mp3&speaker=cove&modelId=mistv2&phonemizeBetweenBrackets=true
Authorization Bearer <RIME_API_KEY>

#With a message like:
{"text": "This "},
{"text": "is "},
{"text": "a "},
{"text": "test against the "},
{"text": "websockets endpoint of the "},
{"text": "api image. "},
{"operation": "flush"},
{"text": "This "},
{"text": "is "},
{"text": "an "},
{"text": "incomplete "},
{"text": "phrase "},
{"operation": "eos"}
```

## Scaling and Concurrency

Rime services support independent scaling configurations:

- **min_replicas**: Minimum instances to maintain (0 for scale-to-zero). Recommended: 1.
- **max_replicas**: Maximum instances during high load.
- **replica_concurrency**: Concurrent requests per instance. Recommended: 3.
- **cooldown**: Time window (in seconds) that must pass at reduced concurrency before scaling down. Recommended: 50.
- **compute**: Instance type. Recommended: `AMPERE_A10`.

Adjust these parameters based on traffic patterns and latency requirements. Best would be to consult the Rime team
about concurrency and scalability
