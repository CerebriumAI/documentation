title: "Sending File Input"
---

You may also use files as input data to your model. 
This is particularly useful if you have a model that takes in images, audio files, or other binary data. 
To do this, you will need to supply at least an initial pre-processing function. 
You can then use the files in your model as you would any other input data.
It is important to note that `conduit.run` expects the files to be passed in as **binary data** on the cloud, so you will need to open the files and read them in as binary data before passing them to test with `conduit.run` locally.

```python
def pre_process(data, files):
    import numpy as np
    from PIL import Image
    labelled = {d: Image.open(f) for d, f in zip(data, files)}
    return labelled

from cerebrium import Conduit, model_type
conduit = Conduit('<MODEL_NAME>', '<API_KEY>', [('<MODEL_TYPE>', '<MODEL_FILE>', {"pre": pre_process"})])
conduit.load('./')
conduit.run(data, [files]) # files should be binary objects - for images it would the return of Image.open(f)
conduit.deploy()
```

### Request and Response with Forms
<Note>
  You currently cannot use `model_api_request` with file input. You will need to use **curl** instead.
</Note>

<RequestExample>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \
      --header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      -F data='[<DATA_INPUT>]' \
      -F files=@<FILES_PATH>
```
</RequestExample>
The parameters to a form request are similar to a JSON request, however both the `data` and `files` are passed in as *form data*.

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  This is the Cerebrium API key used to authenticate your request. You can get it from your Cerebrium dashboard.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="Content-Type" type="string" required>
   The content type of your request. Must be multipart/form-data for forms.
</ParamField>
<ParamField form="data" type="string" required>
   A stringified list of data points you would like to send to your model. e.g. for 1 data point of 3 features: '[[1,2,3]]'.
</ParamField>
<ParamField form="files" type="file" required>
   A file or list of files you would like to send to your model. The files should be in the same order as the data points in the `data` field.
</ParamField>


<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "result": [<MODEL_PREDICTION>],
  "run_id": "<RUN_ID>",
  "run_time_ms": <RUN_TIME_MS>
  "prediction_ids": ["<PREDICTION_ID>"]
}
```
</ResponseExample>

#### Response Parameters
<ResponseField name="result" type="array" required>
  The result of your model prediction.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="run_id" type="string" required>
  The run ID associated with your model predictions.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="run_time_ms" type="float" required>
  The amount of time if took your model to run down to the millisecond. This is what we charge you based on.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="prediction_ids" type="array" required>
  The prediction IDs associated with each of your model predictions. Used to track your model predictions with monitoring tools.
