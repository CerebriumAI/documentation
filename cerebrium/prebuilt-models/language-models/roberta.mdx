title: "Roberta"
description: "Raw model for masked language modeling, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task"
---

RoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. It was trained on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.
It was introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta). This model is case-sensitive: it makes a difference between english and English.
We currently have the following Roberta models available below however if you would like any others contact support, and we can quickly add it for you. To deploy it, you can use the identifier below:

- Roberta Large: `roberta-large`

Once you've deployed a Roberta model, you can supply the endpoint with a prompt. Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:

#### Request Parameters

<RequestExample>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://run.cerebrium.ai/roberta-large-webhook/predict' \
      --header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "prompt": "<mask> is the capital of France"
    }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  This is the Cerebrium API key used to authenticate your request. You can get it from your Cerebrium dashboard.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
   The prompt you would like Roberta to process. Please make sure that you include the \<mask\> keyword.
</ParamField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
  "run_id": "<UUID_STRING>",
  "run_time_ms": 251,
  "message": "Successfully generated text",
  "result": [{'sequence': "<s>Paris</s>",
    'score': 0.3317350447177887,
    'token': 2943,
    'token_str': 'Paris'},
  {'sequence': "<s>Nice</s>",
    'score': 0.14171843230724335,
    'token': 2734,
    'token_str': 'Nice'},
    ...
  ]`
```

</ResponseExample>

#### Response Parameters

<ResponseField name="run_id" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the run that you can use to associate prompts with
  webhook endpoints.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="run_time_ms" type="string" required>
  The amount of time in millisecond it took to run your function. This is what
  you will be billed for.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  Whether of not the response was successful
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="result" type="string" required>
  The result generated from Roberta
</ResponseField>
