As a business associate to covered entities in the healthcare sector, Cerebrium has implemented robust measures to support HIPAA compliance:

### Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

- Cerebrium offers a standardized BAA to all customers who require HIPAA compliance.
- Our BAA clearly outlines the responsibilities and obligations of both parties in protecting Protected Health Information (PHI).
- Customers can initiate the BAA process by contacting compliance@cerebrium.ai.

### PHI Handling and Storage

- Cerebrium's infrastructure is designed to handle PHI securely, with encryption at rest and in transit.
- We do not access, use, or disclose PHI unless explicitly required for providing our services.
- Customers are responsible for de-identifying PHI before transmission to Cerebrium's systems, if de-identification is required for their use case.

### Access Controls

- Strict access controls are in place to ensure that only authorized personnel can access systems that may contain PHI.
- Role-based access controls are used to limit access to PHI based on job responsibilities and the principle of least privilege.

### Audit Logging

- Comprehensive audit logs are maintained for all activities that could potentially involve PHI.
- These logs are available to support customers' accounting of disclosures requirements.

### Breach Notification

- Cerebrium has a robust incident response plan that includes HIPAA-compliant breach notification procedures.
- Any potential breaches involving PHI are promptly investigated and reported to affected customers within required timeframes.

### Employee Training

- All Cerebrium employees undergo HIPAA awareness training as part of their onboarding process.
- Regular refresher training is conducted to ensure ongoing HIPAA compliance.

### Risk Assessments

- Cerebrium conducts regular risk assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in our handling of PHI.
- These assessments are part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining a secure environment for our customers' sensitive data.

### Subcontractors

- Any subcontractors who may have access to PHI are required to sign a BAA and comply with the same HIPAA requirements as Cerebrium.

### Data Retention and Destruction

- Cerebrium adheres to HIPAA-compliant data retention policies.
- Secure data destruction processes are in place for when PHI needs to be deleted or when a customer relationship ends.

### Compliance Monitoring

- Our HIPAA compliance measures are continuously monitored and updated to align with any changes in regulations or best practices.
