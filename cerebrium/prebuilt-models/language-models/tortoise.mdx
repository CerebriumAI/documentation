Tortoise is a text-to-speech model that prioritizes strong multi-voice capabilities highly realistic prosody and intonation. It is not the fastest model since it runs
a autoregressive decoder and a diffusion decoder. Typically it takes a minute inference for 2 sentances, so if you are doing longer sentances we recommend you use the webhook functionality. 
You can read more from the github repo [here](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).

Once you've deployed a Tortoise model, you can simply supply a prompt and a random voice will be used to generate the response.:
