## Installation

The package is available from the public PyPi. Install it using the following
command:

```bash

```

If you have trouble installing the package, please [contact](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) the team immediately!

## Set up your Cerebrium account

1. If you haven't already, sign up for
   [Cerebrium](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai) using your email address or
   Google login credentials.
2. From your dashboard you will be able to view all deployed models, API calls,
   versions and invite teammates!

## How to best use Cerebrium

Depending on the model/application you would like to deploy, we have several ways for you to deploy this as quickly as possible:

1. If you would like to use a common, popular model like Stable Diffusion 2 or Whisper, you can deploy these types of models in one click from your Cerebrium dashboard or using the [framework](cerebrium/prebuilt-models/deployment). You can see the full list of models that we have pre-built in your dashboard or in these docs. 
2. If you simply want to deploy a model that you have custom built/trained that can be serialized into one file such as a model.pt (Pytorch) or iris.json (XGBoost) etc. then the best would be to follow one of our Quickstarts and deploy it with one line of code.
3. If your needs aren't met by either of the first two options, you should use our framework to deploy any [custom Python code](/quickstarts/custom) to serverless CPUs/GPUs. This is best when:
   - You would like more control under the hood of what you are building
   - You require a development environment that needs access to powerful GPU's but don't want to set up dependencies and drivers in a virtual server
   - Are deploying code that requires dependencies that aren't available via pip such as local files or Git repositories.
