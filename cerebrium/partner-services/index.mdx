<Note>Partner Services are available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater</Note>

Cerebrium offers specialized services in partnership with leading AI companies. These Partner Services feature simplified configurations, independent scaling, and quick deployment.

Currently, Cerebrium offers the following Partner Services:

- [Deepgram](/cerebrium/partner-services/deepgram) - Speech-to-text (STT) services
- [Rime](/cerebrium/partner-services/rime) - Text-to-speech (TTS) services

## Benefits of Partner Services

Partner Services provide several advantages:

- Simplified configuration with specialized TOML sections
- Independent scaling of each service
- Quick and easy deployment
- Reduced latency by running models on the same network as the app

## API Keys

To use Partner Services, you need to provide API keys through Cerebrium's secrets management:

1. Navigate to the **Secrets** tab in your Cerebrium dashboard
2. Add your API key as either an app-specific or project-wide secret
3. The secret will be automatically available as an environment variable in your deployment

## Scaling and Concurrency

Partner Services support independent scaling configurations:

- Use the `min_replicas` and `max_replicas` parameters to control the number of instances
- The `replica_concurrency` parameter determines how many concurrent requests each instance can handle
- Adjust the `cooldown` parameter to control how long instances remain active after processing requests
