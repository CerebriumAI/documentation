## Intro

By the end of this guide you'll have an API endpoint that can handle any scale
of traffic by running inference on serverless CPU's/GPU's.

## Project set up

Before building you need to set up a Cerebrium account. This is as simple as
starting a new Project in Cerebrium and copying the API key. This will be used
to authenticate all calls for this project.

### Create a project

1. Go to [dashboard.cerebrium.ai](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai)
2. Signup or Login
3. Navigate to Settings page
4. Navigate to the API Keys tab
5. You should see an API key with the source "Cerebrium". Click the eye icon to
   display it. It will be in the format: c_api_key-xxx

### Develop model

Now navigate to where your model code is stored. This could be in a notebook or
in a plain `.py` file.

To start you should install the Cerebrium framework running the following
command in your notebook or terminal

```bash
pip install cerebrium
```

Copy and paste our code below. This creates a simple Convolutional Neural
Network. This code could be replaced by any Pytorch model. Make sure you have
the required libraries installed.

```bash
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pickle

iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

rf = RandomForestClassifier()
rf.fit(X, y)

# Save to pickle
with open("iris.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(rf, f)
```

In the last line of code, there are two ways you can save the model. This is all
you need to deploy your model to Cerebrium! You can then import the `deploy()`
function from the Cerebrium framework. I used the CloudPickle function to save
my model below.

```bash
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type

endpoint = endpoint = deploy((model_type.SKLEARN, "iris.pkl"), "sk-test-model" , "<API_KEY>")
```

Your model is now deployed and ready for inference all in under **10 seconds**!
Navigate to the dashboard and on the Models page you will see your model.

You can run inference using `curl`

```bash
curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \
--header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]'
```

and your response should be:

Navigate back to the dashboard and click on the name of the model you just
deployed. You will see an API call was made and the inference time. From your
dashboard you can monitor your model, roll back to previous versions and see
traffic.

With one line of code, your model was deployed in seconds with automatic
versioning, monitoring and the ability to scale based on traffic spikes. Try
deploying your own model now or check out our other frameworks.
