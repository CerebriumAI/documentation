In order to deploy the model you can use the identifier below:

- Stable Diffusion Upscaler: `sd-upscaler`

This model was trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images >2048x2048. The model was trained on crops of size 512x512 and is a text-guided latent upscaling diffusion model. 
You can read more from Once you've deployed a this model, you can follow this example of how to call the deployed endpoint:
