description: Getting started on the Cerebrium platform
---

Cerebrium is a serverless infrastructure platform for building and scaling data and AI workloads.

- Launch your code in the cloud in seconds
- Define your own [containers environments](/cerebrium/container-images/defining-container-images) or bring your own [Dockerfile](/cerebrium/container-images/custom-dockerfiles)
- Run [CPUs](/cerebrium/hardware/cpu-and-memory) or [GPUs](/cerebrium/hardware/using-gpus) at scale—with support for thousands of concurrent containers
- [Scale](/cerebrium/scaling/scaling-apps) based on concurrency, Requests per second or CPU/Memory utilization,
- Serve [WebSockets](/cerebrium/endpoints/websockets), [REST APIs](/cerebrium/endpoints/inference-api), or any [ASGI-compatible app](/cerebrium/container-images/custom-web-servers)
- Store model weights, files, and more with [distributed storage](/cerebrium/storage/managing-files)
- Pay only for the compute you use — [billed by the second](https://www.cerebrium.ai/pricing)

Cerebrium abstracts the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on building AI products users love!

## Getting Started

Setting up and deploying an app on Cerebrium takes just a few steps:

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
pip install cerebrium
cerebrium login  # Redirects to your browser for authentication
```

### 2. Initialize a Project

```bash
cerebrium init my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

This creates a basic project with `main.py` for app code and `cerebrium.toml` for configuration. This is was the main.py file contains:

```python
def run(param_1: str, param_2: str, run_id):  # run_id is optional, injected by Cerebrium at runtime
    my_results = {"1": param_1, "2": param_2}
    my_status_code = 200

    return {"my_result": my_results, "status_code": my_status_code}
```

This will turn the function into a callable endpoint that accepts json parameters (param_1 and param_2) and can scale to 1000s of requests.

### 3. Deploy an App

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

The app now builds and deploys, typically within a few seconds. Check out a detailed description of the deployment process for more information. Once deployed, an app becomes callable through an endpoint `https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/{project-id}/{app-name}/{function-name}`.

## How It Works

Cerebrium uses containerization to ensure consistent environments and reliable scaling for apps. When code is deployed, Cerebrium packages it with all necessary dependencies into a container image. This image serves as a blueprint for creating instances that handle incoming requests. The system automatically manages scaling, creating new instances when traffic increases and removing them during quiet periods.

For a detailed explanation of how Cerebrium builds and manages container images, see our [Defining Container Images Guide](/cerebrium/container-images/defining-container-images).

<Info>
  Content-Aware Storage forms the foundation of Cerebrium's speed. This system
  intelligently manages container images by understanding their content
  structure. When launching new instances, it pulls only the specific files.
  This targeted approach significantly reduces cold start times and optimizes
  resource usage.
