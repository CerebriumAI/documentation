Cerebrium and its community keep a library of popular pre-built models that you can deploy using one click. If you would like any pre-built models added you can:

- [Submit PR on Github](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/cerebrium-prebuilts) All our prebuilt models live here so submit a PR or one you would like to contribute to the community. Instructions in the README :)
- Post a [bounty](https://www.cerebrium.ai/bounties) for our community to create it
- [Contact](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) the Cerebrium team and we will see what we can do

You can deploy prebuilt models via Cerebrium by using a simple one-click deploy from your dashboard by navigating to the <b>Prebuilt tab</b>.

Check out the available models through your dashboard or by reading our docs below!
