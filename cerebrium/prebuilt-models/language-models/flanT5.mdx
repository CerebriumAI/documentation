FLAN, which stands for Fine-tuned LAnguage Net (FLAN), is a technique for instruction tuning to learn how to solve natural language processing tasks in general.
It can be used to answer questions or tasks across many languages â€” you can read more [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/10/introducing-flan-more-generalizable.html). We currently have the following Flan-T5 models available below, however, if you would like any others contact support, and we can quickly add it for you. To deploy it, you can use the identifier below:

- Flan XL: `flan-t5-xl`

Once you've deployed a FLAN model, you can supply the endpoint with a prompt. Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:
