title: "Gradual Roll-out"
description: "Control the transition between revisions during deployments"
---

<Note>This feature is available from CLI version 1.38.2</Note>

The `roll_out_duration_seconds` parameter in the `[cerebrium.scaling]` section of your `cerebrium.toml` file controls how quickly traffic transitions between revisions after a successful build.

## Overview

When you deploy a new version of your app, Cerebrium creates a new revision. The `roll_out_duration_seconds` parameter determines how long it takes to transition traffic from the old revision to the new one.

Traffic is shifted in 5 batches of 20% each, over the specified duration. This gradual transition helps ensure a smooth user experience and minimizes disruptions.

## Configuration

Add the `roll_out_duration_seconds` parameter to the `[cerebrium.scaling]` section of your `cerebrium.toml` file:

```toml
[cerebrium.scaling]
roll_out_duration_seconds = 0  # Default value
```

## Parameters

- **Valid range**: 0-600 seconds
- **Default value**: 0 (immediate transition)

## Best Practices

- **Development environments**: Keep the value at 0 during development for immediate transitions
- **Production environments**: Use lower values to optimize cost and resources while ensuring smooth transitions
- **High-traffic applications**: Consider using higher values for gradual transitions to minimize disruption
