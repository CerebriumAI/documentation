description: Deploy Deepgram speech-to-text services on Cerebrium

<Note>
  Deepgram Partner Service is available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater
</Note>

Cerebrium's partnership with [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/) allows you to easily deploy speech-to-text (STT) services with simplified configuration and independent scaling.

## Configuration

Deepgram services use a simplified TOML configuration with the `[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]` section:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "deepgram"

[cerebrium.runtime.deepgram]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 4
region = "eu-south-2"
memory = 32
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
gpu_count = 1

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 0
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 1800
replica_concurrency = 10
```

## API Key Configuration

To use Deepgram services, you need to provide your Deepgram API key:

1. Sign up for a Deepgram account at [deepgram.com](https://www.deepgram.com/)
2. Create an API key from your Deepgram dashboard
3. Add the API key to Cerebrium:
   - Navigate to the **Secrets** tab in your Cerebrium dashboard
   - Add your Deepgram API key as either an app-specific or project-wide secret. The name of the secret should be `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
   - The secret will be automatically available as an environment variable in your deployment

## Scaling and Concurrency

Deepgram services support independent scaling configurations:

- **min_replicas**: Minimum number of instances to maintain (0 for scale-to-zero)
- **max_replicas**: Maximum number of instances that can be created during high load
- **replica_concurrency**: Number of concurrent requests each instance can handle
- **cooldown**: Time in seconds that an instance remains active after processing its last request

Adjust these parameters based on your expected traffic patterns and latency requirements.

## Model Storage

The project's default storage volume is attached to the engine container.

All model files that you want to load (provided by Deepgram) need to be uploaded to the `/deepgram-models` folder. You can use this command to upload the files:

```bash
cerebrium cp model.dg deepgram-models/model.dg
```

## Usage Examples

Deepgram services are particularly useful for voice agent applications. For example, Cerebrium runs Deepgram STT models on the same network as the app next to LiveKit workers, which reduces latency by approximately 400ms.

For a complete example of using Deepgram in a voice agent application, see the [LiveKit Outbound Agent example](/v4/examples/livekit-outbound-agent).
