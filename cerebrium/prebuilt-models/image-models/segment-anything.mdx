title: "Segment Anything"
description: "A prompt based segmentation model from Meta AI"
---

In order to deploy the model you can use the identifier below:

- Segment Anything: `segment-anything`

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image. It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks.

You can follow this example of how to call the deployed endpoint:
