Tortoise is a text-to-speech model that prioritizes strong multi-voice capabilities highly realistic prosody and intonation. It is not the fastest model since it runs
an autoregressive decoder and a diffusion decoder. Typically, it takes a minute inference for 2 sentences, so if you are doing longer sentences we recommend you use the webhook functionality.
You can read more from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).

Once you've deployed a Tortoise model, you can simply supply a prompt and a random voice will be used to generate the response.:

#### Request Parameters

<RequestExample>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://run.cerebrium.ai/tortise-webhook/predict' \
      --header 'Authorization: <API_KEY>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "prompt": "Is this what my voice sounds like"
        "webhook_endpoint": "<WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT>",
        "file_url": "<FILE_URL>"
        }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  This is the Cerebrium API key used to authenticate your request. You can get

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" optional>
  The prompt that you would like turned into a voice media file.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="webhook_endpoint" type="string" optional>
  A http endpoint that we can notify with the results of the model once it has
  finished processing.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="file_url" type="string" optional>
  A publicly accessible url for us to fetch a custom voice to use. You need to
  specify 'custom' for the voice parameter.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="voice" type="string" optional>
  A pre-loaded voice you wish to use for your text. By default a random voice

<ResponseExample>

```json Response

    "run_time_ms": 32305.,
    "message": "Successfully generated media file",
    "result": {
        "audio": <BASE_64_STRING>
    }
}
```

</ResponseExample>

#### Response Parameters

<ResponseField name="run_id" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the run that you can use to associate prompts with
  webhook endpoints.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="run_time_ms" type="string" required>
  The amount of time in millisecond it took to run your function. This is what
  you will be billed for.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  Whether of not the response was successful
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="audio" type="string" required>
  A base64 encoded string of your media file
</ResponseField>

To convert you base64 encoded string to a media file you can run the following code snippet:

```python
decoded_bytes = base64.decodebytes(audio.split(',')[1].encode("ascii"))

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as mp3file:
    mp3_file.write(decoded_bytes)
```
