## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a image generation model that can receive either text or image input and output network-generated images! We currently have Stable Diffusion v2 available

- Stable Diffusion v2: `stable-diffusion-2`

Once you've deployed a Stable Diffusion model, you can supply the enpoint with string with what image you would like to generate. Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://inference.cerebrium.ai/runs/YOUR_ENDPOINT' \
-H 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
        "prompt": "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
    }'
```
