title: Cortex Config Files
description: Using config files to configure Cortex deployments easily and quickly
---

Deploying your model with Cortex is a fast and simple process, however, there are a few parameters to keep track of and you may not want to type them out every time you deploy.
To make this process easier, Cortex supports the use of config files. 
Config files are YAML files that contain all of the parameters that you would normally pass to the CLI. 

Using config files also makes it easier to keep track of your Cerebrium deployments, share them and use versioning tools such as git. 

## Using Config Files
To deploy your model with a config file, you can use the `cortex deploy` command with the `--config-file` flag to specify the path to your config file. 

```bash
cerebrium deploy --config-file your_config_file.yaml
``` 

Your config file can be named anything you want and can be placed anywhere on your local machine. However, remember to use the `cerebrium deploy` command in the same directory as your main.py as you would normally.

You can alternatively use the `cerebrium init-cortex-project` command to generate your config file and setup a Cortex project in your desired directory. See [here](/cerebrium/cortex/advanced-functionality/init-cortex-project) for more info.

### Config File Format and Parameters
The parameters for your config file are the same as those which you would use for a normal `cerebrium deploy` command. They're tabulated below for your convenience:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the deployment | string |  |
| `api_key` | API key for the deployment | string | not included for safety |
| `hardware` | Hardware to use for the deployment | string | GPU |
| `log_level` | Log level for the deployment | string | INFO |
| `include` | Files to include in the deployment | string | '[./*, main.py, requirements.txt, pkglist.txt, conda_pkglist.txt]' |
| `exclude` | Files to exclude from the deployment | string | '[./.*, ./__*]' |
| `disable_animation` | Whether to disable the animation in the logs. | boolean | false |

## Config File Example

```yaml
%YAML 1.2
---
name: an-optional-name
api_key: an-optional-api-key
hardware: GPU
exclude: '[./.*, ./__*]'
include: '[./*, main.py, requirements.txt, pkglist.txt, conda_pkglist.txt]'
log_level: INFO
disable_animation: false
```
