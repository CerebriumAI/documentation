description: "Cerebrium provides prebuilt models that you can deploy to an API seamlessly"

Cerebrium and its community keep a library of popular pre-built models that you can deploy using one click. If you would like any pre-built models added you can:

- [Submit PR on Github](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/cerebrium-prebuilts) All our prebuilt models live here so submit a PR or one you would like to contribute to the community. Instructions in the README :)
- [Contact](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) the Cerebrium team and we will see what we can do

You can deploy prebuilt models via Cerebrium by using a simple one-click deploy from your dashboard by navigating to the <b>Prebuilt tab</b>. Otherwise, if
you would like to read through the source code, you can navigate to the [Cerebrium Prebuilts Github](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/cerebrium-prebuilts) where you can find the source code for each of the models.

Each model's folder is a cortex deployment that can be deployed using the `cerebrium deploy` command. Simply navigate to the folder of the model you would like to deploy and run the command.

```bash
cerebrium deploy <<your-name-for-your-model>>
```

Check out the available models through your Cerebrium dashboard or by reading our docs in the **Prebuilt Models** tab!
