title: "Real-time Voice Agent"
description: "Deploy a real-time AI voice agent"
---

In this tutorial, we'll create a real-time voice agent that responds to queries via speech in ~500ms. This flexible implementation lets you swap in any Large Language Model (LLM) or Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. It's ideal for voice-based use cases like customer support bots and receptionists.

To create this app, we use [PipeCat](https://www.pipecat.ai/), a framework that handles component integration, user interruptions, and audio data processing. We'll demonstrate this by joining a meeting room with our voice agent using [Daily](https://daily.co) (PipeCat's creators) and deploy the app on Cerebrium for seamless deployment and scaling.

You can find the final version of the code [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/tree/master/6-voice/2-realtime-voice-agent)

### Cerebrium setup

If you don't have a Cerebrium account, you can create one by signing up [here](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai/register) and following the documentation [here](https://docs.cerebrium.ai/cerebrium/getting-started/installation) to get set up.

In your IDE, run the following command to create our Cerebrium starter project: `cerebrium init 2-realtime-agent`. This creates two files:

- `main.py`: Our entrypoint file where our code lives
- `cerebrium.toml`: A configuration file that contains all our build and environment settings

Add the following pip packages to your `cerebrium.toml` to create your deployment environment:

```
[cerebrium.deployment]
docker_base_image_url = "registry.cerebrium.ai/daily:latest"

[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
torch = ">=2.0.0"
"pipecat-ai[silero, daily, openai, deepgram]" = "latest"
aiohttp = "latest"
torchaudio = "latest"
vllm = "latest"
huggingface_hub = "latest"
```

We specify a Docker base image that contains local [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, provided by Daily. Running everything locally instead of over the network helps achieve low latency.

<Note>
  Docker files are not support yet but are rather in the works to be released
  soon. This is just a very early preview of how it would work.
</Note>

We'll use Llama 3 8B as our LLM, served via vLLM. First, request access to [Llama 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) on Hugging Face (approval typically takes less than 30 minutes).

Add your Hugging Face token as a secret named "HF_TOKEN" in your Cerebrium dashboard under "Secrets". This allows secure access to the token at runtime.

You can then add the following code to your main.py:

```python
from huggingface_hub import login
import subprocess

login(token=get_secret('HF_TOKEN'))
# Run vllM Server in background process
def start_server():
    while True:
        process = subprocess.Popen(f"python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --port 5000 --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --dtype bfloat16 --api-key {get_secret('HF_TOKEN')} --download-dir /persistent-storage/", shell=True)
        process.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
        logger.error("Server process ended unexpectedly. Restarting in 5 seconds...")
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait before restarting

# Start the server in a separate process
server_process = Process(target=start_server)
server_process.start()
```

Since PipeCat requires models to follow the OpenAI-compatible format and doesn't support local instantiation, we run the vLLM server locally in a background process. We monitor the process for successful launch due to a known issue with rapidly starting multiple vLLM instances, retrying after 5 seconds if needed. The server runs on port 5000 (port 8000 is reserved for Cerebrium), and we set a persistent download directory to speed up subsequent cold starts.

Now we implement the Pipecat framework by instantiating the various components. Create a function called "main" with the following code:

```python
import aiohttp
import os
import sys
import subprocess
import time
import requests
import asyncio
from multiprocessing import Process
from loguru import logger

from pipecat.vad.vad_analyzer import VADParams
from pipecat.vad.silero import SileroVADAnalyzer
from pipecat.transports.services.daily import DailyParams, DailyTransport
from pipecat.services.openai import OpenAILLMService
from pipecat.services.deepgram import DeepgramSTTService
from pipecat.pipeline.task import PipelineParams, PipelineTask
from pipecat.pipeline.runner import PipelineRunner
from pipecat.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
from pipecat.frames.frames import LLMMessagesFrame, EndFrame

from pipecat.processors.aggregators.llm_response import (
    LLMAssistantResponseAggregator, LLMUserResponseAggregator
)

from helpers import (
    ClearableDeepgramTTSService,
    AudioVolumeTimer,
    TranscriptionTimingLogger
)

logger.remove(0)
logger.add(sys.stderr, level="DEBUG")

deepgram_voice: str = "aura-asteria-en"

async def main(room_url: str, token: str = None):

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        transport = DailyTransport(
            room_url,
            token if token else get_secret("DAILY_TOKEN"),
            "Respond bots",
            DailyParams(
                audio_out_enabled=True,
                transcription_enabled=False,
                vad_enabled=True,
                vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer(params=VADParams(
                    stop_secs=0.2
                )),
                vad_audio_passthrough=True
            )
        )

        stt = DeepgramSTTService(
            name="STT",
            api_key=None,
            url='ws://127.0.0.1:8082/v1/listen'
        )

        tts = ClearableDeepgramTTSService(
            name="Voice",
            aiohttp_session=session,
            api_key=None,
            voice=deepgram_voice,
            base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8082/v1/speak"
        )

        llm = OpenAILLMService(
            name="LLM",
            api_key=get_secret("HF_TOKEN"),
            model="casperhansen/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq",
            base_url="http://0.0.0.0:5000/v1"
        )

        messages = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful LLM in a WebRTC call. Your goal is to demonstrate your capabilities in a succinct way. Your output will be converted to audio so don't include special characters in your answers. Respond to what the user said in a creative and helpful way.",
            },
        ]

        avt = AudioVolumeTimer()
        tl = TranscriptionTimingLogger(avt)

        tma_in = LLMUserResponseAggregator(messages)
        tma_out = LLMAssistantResponseAggregator(messages)

        pipeline = Pipeline([
            transport.input(),   # Transport user input
            avt,                 # Audio volume timer
            stt,                 # Speech-to-text
            tl,                  # Transcription timing logger
            tma_in,              # User responses
            llm,                 # LLM
            tts,                 # TTS
            transport.output(),  # Transport bot output
            tma_out,             # Assistant spoken responses
        ])

        task = PipelineTask(
            pipeline,
            PipelineParams(
                allow_interruptions=True,
                enable_metrics=True,
                report_only_initial_ttfb=True
            ))
```

In our main function, we initialize the Daily transport layer to handle audio/video data from the Daily room. We pass the room URL and authentication token for programmatic joining. We set the VAD stop seconds to 200 milliseconds, which defines the pause duration before the bot responds.

Next, we connect to our locally running Deepgram models from our Docker base image on port 8082. The PipeCat framework handles audio-to-text and text-to-audio conversion. We then connect to our local LLM model from the vLLM server. Note: Set the Deepgram API key to `None` to use the local instance.

Finally, we combine everything into a PipelineTask, which PipeCat executes. Tasks are fully customizable and support Image and Vision use cases (learn more [here](https://docs.pipecat.ai/docs/category/services)). Pipeline tasks include built-in interruption handling and easy model swapping capabilities.

The Daily Python SDK provides event webhooks to trigger functionality based on events like users joining or leaving calls. Add this event handling code to the `main()` function:

```python
# When the first participant joins, the bot should introduce itself.
@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    # Kick off the conversation.
    messages.append(
        {"role": "system", "content": "Please introduce yourself to the user."})
    await task.queue_frame(LLMMessagesFrame(messages))

# When a participant joins, start transcription for that participant so the
# bot can "hear" and respond to them.
@transport.event_handler("on_participant_joined")
async def on_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])

# When the participant leaves, we exit the bot.
@transport.event_handler("on_participant_left")
async def on_participant_left(transport, participant, reason):
    await task.queue_frame(EndFrame())

# If the call is ended make sure we quit as well.
@transport.event_handler("on_call_state_updated")
async def on_call_state_updated(transport, state):
    if state == "left":
        await task.queue_frame(EndFrame())

runner = PipelineRunner()

await runner.run(task)
await session.close()
```

This code handles these events:

- First participant joins: Bot introduces itself via a conversation message
- Additional participants join: Bot listens and responds to all participants
- Participant leaves or call ends: Bot terminates itself

Events are attached to Transport (our meeting room communication method). The Pipeline task runs through our pipeline runner until signaled to exit (when a call ends). Learn more about PipeCat's infrastructure [here](https://docs.pipecat.ai/docs/understanding-bots/dailyai-architecture).

We run the code in a separate execution environment to prevent multiple PipeCat instances. This background process serves as the entry point for our REST API endpoint to start the PipeCat bot. When the call ends and the bot returns, we send a response to our API endpoint.
We therefore create the following function:

<NOTE>
  Currently, Cerebrium does not support workloads running longer than 5 minutes
  however it is currently being worked on internally and will be released soon.
  This means that conversations are limited to a 5 minute window. If this is a
  issue and you have a urgent use case, please reach out to
  [support](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai)
</NOTE>

```python
def start_bot(room_url: str, token: str = None):

    def target():
        asyncio.run(main(room_url, token))

    check_model_status()
    process = Process(target=target)
    process.start()
    process.join()  # Wait for the process to complete
    return {"message": "session finished"}
```

That's it! You now have a fully functioning AI bot that interacts with users through speech in ~500ms. Imagine the possibilities!

Now, let's create a user interface for the bot.

## Creating Meeting Room

Cerebrium can run any Python code, not just AI workloads. For our demo, we define two functions that use the Daily REST API to create a room and temporary token, both valid for 5 minutes.

Get your Daily developer token from your profile. If you don't have an account, sign up [here](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup) (they offer a generous free tier). Navigate to the "developers" tab to get your API key and add it to your Cerebrium Secrets.

![Daily API Key](/images/examples/voice_agent/daily-api-key.png)

Create a room that lasts 5 minutes and a temporary access token:

```python
def create_room():
    url = "https://api.daily.co/v1/rooms/"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {get_secret('DAILY_TOKEN')}"
    }
    data = {
        "properties": {
            "exp": int(time.time()) + 60*5 ##5 mins
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        room_info = response.json()
        token = create_token(room_info['name'])
        if token and 'token' in token:
            room_info['token'] = token['token']
        else:
            logger.error("Failed to create token")
            return {"message": 'There was an error creating your room', "status_code": 500}
        return room_info
    else:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create room: {response.status_code}")
        return {"message": 'There was an error creating your room', "status_code": 500}

def create_token(room_name: str):
    url = "https://api.daily.co/v1/meeting-tokens"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {get_secret('DAILY_TOKEN')}"
    }
    data = {
        "properties": {
            "room_name": room_name
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        token_info = response.json()
        return token_info
    else:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create token: {response.status_code}")
        return None
```

### Deploy to Cerebrium

Deploy the app to Cerebrium by running this command in your terminal: `cerebrium deploy`

A successful deployment looks like this:

![Cerebrium Deployment](/images/examples/langchain_langsmith/cerebrium_deploy.png)

We'll add these endpoints to our frontend interface.

## Connect frontend

We created a public fork of the PipeCat frontend to show you a nice demo of this application. You can clone the repo [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/web-client-ui).

Follow the instructions in the README.md and then populate the following variables in your .env.development.local

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxx/<APP_NAME> #This is the base url. Do not include the function names
VITE_SERVER_AUTH= #This is the JWT token you can get from the API Keys section of your Cerebrium Dashboard.
```

You can now run yarn dev and go to the URL: http://localhost:5173/ to test your application!

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides a foundation for implementing voice in your app and extending into image and vision capabilities. PipeCat is an extensible, open-source framework for building voice-enabled apps, while Cerebrium provides seamless deployment and autoscaling with pay-as-you-go compute.
