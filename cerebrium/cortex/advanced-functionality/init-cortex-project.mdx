title: Init Cortex Project
description: Using the CLI to quickly initialise a Cortex project.
---


You can quickly set up a Cortex project by running the following command:
```bash
cerebrium init-cortex-project <<your_initialisation_directory>> 
```

This will create a Cortex project in the specified directory with the following structure:

```
your_project/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── pkglist.txt
├── conda_pkglist.txt
└── config.yaml
```

## Configuring your Cortex Project

The initial files are initialised with some default values, and you can add to your requirements.txt, pkglist.txt and conda_pkglist.txt as you would normally.  
Alternatively, you can use the `--requirements-list`, `--pkg-list` and `--conda-pkglist` commands to customise the contents of these files.

For example, you can add a few packages to your requirements.txt as follows:

```bash 
--requirements-list "['transformers', 'datasets', 'sentencepiece==0.1.97']"
```


The `config.yaml` file contains the parameters for your deployment.
It is initialised with the following default values:

```yaml
%YAML 1.2
---
hardware: GPU
include: '[./*, main.py, requirements.txt, pkglist.txt, conda_pkglist.txt]'
exclude: '[./.*, ./__*]'
log_level: INFO
disable_animation: false
```

However, you can change each of these values by using their respective flags as you would with a normal cortex deployment. For example, to change the hardware to CPU, you can run:
See the documentation [here](/cerebrium/cortex/advanced-functionality/config-files) for more info on config files.
