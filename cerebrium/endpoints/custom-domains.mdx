description: "Connect your own domain to your Cerebrium project"

Custom domains allow serving Cerebrium apps through custom domains instead of the default `*.cerebrium.ai` URLs.
Once configured, API calls will use the custom domain while keeping the same path structure: `api.example.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run`.

## Key Features

- Support for apex domains (`example.com`) and subdomains (`api.example.com`)
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal
- Project-level domains - one domain serves all apps in a project
- Multiple domains can point to the same project
- Professional branding with custom domains instead of `*.cerebrium.ai` URLs

## How Custom Domains Work

- **Domains are region-specific** meaning each will always resolve to the selected region
- **Domains are app-agnostic** enabling connection to any number of deployed apps within a project via custom domain
- **Multiple domains** can be configured on the same project (useful for apps within the project deployed in different regions)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a Custom Domain

1. Navigate to project settings in the Cerebrium dashboard
2. Click on the "Custom Domains" tab
3. Click "Add Custom Domain"
4. Enter the domain name and select the target region (choose the region closest to users for optimal latency)
5. Click "Create Domain"

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records

After creating the domain, DNS configuration instructions will be displayed. Create a CNAME record at the DNS provider using the DNS record Cerebrium generates.

<Note>
  DNS record details can also be found later by clicking "DNS Record" in the
  Custom Domains list.
</Note>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subdomains (Recommended)">
    **Benefits:**
    - Easier DNS configuration
    - Allows other subdomains for different purposes

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: api
    Value: proxy.aws.{region}.cerebrium.ai
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apex Domains">
    **Benefits:**
    - Routes all traffic from the domain root
    - Best for dedicated API domains

    **Note:** ALIAS records are preferred over CNAME since only one CNAME is allowed per domain

    ```
    Type: CNAME (or ALIAS if supported)
    Name: @ (or leave blank)
    Value: proxy.aws.{region}.cerebrium.ai
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>A `{region}` must be selected when creating a custom domain.</Note>

### Step 3: Domain Validation

1. After configuring DNS, return to the Cerebrium dashboard
2. Cerebrium will automatically attempt to validate DNS records every 30 minutes for up to 2 days
3. To trigger an immediate validation attempt, click "Validation Status" -> "Validate Domain", even after the 2 days have elapsed
4. If validation fails, the dialog will show the last known error.
5. Once validated, SSL certificates will be automatically provisioned

### Step 4: Start Using the Custom Domain

Once validation is complete, the custom domain can be used immediately with all apps in the project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="POST Request">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{'inputs': {'prompt': 'Hello world'}}"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GET Request">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.example.com/v4/p-1234/my-app/run \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Domains

### Domain Validation Statuses

Cerebrium will attempt to validate domains once every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 2 days. If a domain is not
being validated, click on "Validation Status" to see the last validation attempt, along with any error that
occurred.

- **Pending**: Domain is waiting for DNS validation
- **Validated**: Domain is successfully validated and ready to use
- **Failed**: DNS validation failed - click "Validation Status" to see the specific error

### Validation Errors

If a domain shows "Failed" status, the DNS record has been misconfigured. Common issues include:

- **Wrong target**: CNAME points to incorrect proxy URL
- **Multiple conflicting records**: Remove any existing ALIAS records for the same hostname

### Common DNS Provider Issues

- **Cloudflare**: Disable proxy (set to "DNS only" - gray cloud icon)
- **Route53**: Use simple routing policy, not weighted or latency-based
- **Namecheap**: Use "@" for apex domains, not "www" or blank
- **GoDaddy**: CNAME records cannot be used with apex domains - consider using a subdomain or an ALIAS record

### Common DNS Mistakes

- **Wrong proxy URL**: Ensure the exact URL provided in the dashboard is being used
- **TTL too high**: Consider lowering TTL before making DNS changes
- **Multiple records**: Remove conflicting A or CNAME records for the same name

## Security Considerations

- Custom domains automatically receive SSL certificates
- All traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- Certificates auto-renew before expiration
- Domain validation ensures control of the domain
