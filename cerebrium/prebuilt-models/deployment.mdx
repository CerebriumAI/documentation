title: "Deploying Prebuilt Models"
description: "Cerebrium provides prebuilt models that you can deploy to an API."
---

You can deploy prebuilt models via Cerebrium using two methods.
<ol>
<li>Doing simple one-click deploys from your dashboard</li>
<li> Through our Python framework. </li>
</ol>
Deploying a prebuilt model through our framework is largely similar to deploying a custom model. The only difference is that you do not need to upload a model file.
Instead, you specify which prebuilt model you want to deploy using the corresponding identifier.

```python Deploy a prebuilt Whisper Model
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type
endpoint = deploy((model_type.PREBUILT, "whisper-medium"), 'my-flow', "<API_KEY>")
```

<Note>
  You can not use prebuilt models in ensembles or with processing
  functions. They should be contained within single model flows only.
</Note>

You can check out the available models below!
