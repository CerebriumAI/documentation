By default, all apps on Cerebrium are accessible via authenticated POST requests. Authentication is handled using the JWT token available in the **API Keys** section of your dashboard.

The POST request follows the structure below, where `{function}` is the name of the function you want to invoke. For example, in this case, the function `predict()` from `main.py` is being called.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxx/{app-name}/{function}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "function_param": "data"
}'
```

Responses follow this format:

```bash
{
    "run_id": "52eda406-b81b-43f5-8deb-fcf80dfsb74b",
    "run_time_ms": 326.34,
    "result": {<data>}
}
```

Successful requests return a status code of 200, while errors result in a status code of 500.

To return custom status codes such as 422, 404, etc., include the `status_code` field in the JSON response from your `main.py`.
