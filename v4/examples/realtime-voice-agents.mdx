title: "Real-time Voice Agent"
description: "Deploy a real-time AI voice agent"
---

In this tutorial, we'll create a real-time voice agent that responds to queries via speech in ~500ms. This flexible implementation lets you swap in any Large Language Model (LLM) or Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. It's ideal for voice-based use cases like customer support bots and receptionists.

To create this app, we use [PipeCat](https://www.pipecat.ai/), a framework that handles component integration, user interruptions, and audio data processing. We'll demonstrate this by joining a meeting room with our voice agent using [Daily](https://daily.co) (PipeCat's creators) and deploy the app on Cerebrium for seamless deployment and scaling.

Essentially our application will have 3/4 parts:

- Your Pipecat agent which acts as the orchestrator
- Your Deepgram TTS/STT service (Requires a Deepgram Enterprise account)
- A self-hosted LLM using the vLLM framework

The reason we achieve such low latency is that each service is hosted within Cerebrium and so we have no network latency for the requests we make - communication across containers is less than 10ms.

You can find the final version of the code [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/tree/master/6-voice/2-realtime-voice-agent)

If you don't have a Cerebrium account, you can create one by signing up [here](https://dashboard.cerebrium.ai/register) and following the documentation [here](https://docs.cerebrium.ai/cerebrium/getting-started/installation) to get set up.

### Deepgram deployment

For the sake of conciseness, look at our Partner Services page to see how you can deploy a Deepgram service on Cerebrium. The link is [here](/cerebrium/partner-services/deepgram)

<Note>
  You need a Deepgram Enterprise License to do deploy Deegram on Cerebrium else
  you must use their API endpoint below.
</Note>

### LLM Deployment

For our LLM we deploy a OpenAI compatible Llama-3 endpoint using the vLLM framework - in order to have a low TTFT we deploy a quantized version (RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w8a8").

Run `cerebrium init llama-llm` and add the following code to your cerebrium.toml:

```
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "llama-llm"
python_version = "3.11"
docker_base_image_url = "debian:bookworm-slim"
include = ["./*", "main.py", "cerebrium.toml"]
exclude = [".*"]

[cerebrium.hardware]
cpu = 4
memory = 12.0
compute = "ADA_L40"

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 1
max_replicas = 5
cooldown = 60

[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
vllm = "latest"
pydantic = "latest"
```

Add the following code to your main.py - this uses the vLLM framework and makes it openAI compatible:

```
import os
import time
import json

from huggingface_hub import login
from pydantic import BaseModel
from vllm import SamplingParams, AsyncLLMEngine
from vllm.engine.arg_utils import AsyncEngineArgs

login(token=os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN"))

engine_args = AsyncEngineArgs(
    model="RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w8a8",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.9,
    max_model_len=8192,
)
engine = AsyncLLMEngine.from_engine_args(engine_args)


class Message(BaseModel):
    role: str
    content: str


def format_chat_prompt(messages: list) -> str:
    formatted_messages = []
    for msg in messages:
        msg_obj = Message(**msg)
        formatted_messages.append(
            f"<|start_header_id|>{msg_obj.role}<|end_header_id|>\n{msg_obj.content}<|eot_id|>"
        )
    return "<|begin_of_text|>" + "".join(formatted_messages) + "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"


async def run(
    messages: list,
    model: str,
    run_id: str,
    stream: bool = True,
    temperature: float = 0.8,
    top_p: float = 0.95,
    max_tokens: int = 256,
    stream_options: dict = None,
):
    # Format your prompt for llama-friendly usage:
    prompt = format_chat_prompt(messages)

    sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=temperature, top_p=top_p, max_tokens=max_tokens)
    results_generator = engine.generate(prompt, sampling_params, run_id)

    previous_text = ""
    first_chunk = True

    async for output in results_generator:
        prompt_output = output.outputs
        new_text = prompt_output[0].text[len(previous_text) :]
        previous_text = prompt_output[0].text

        # Construct OpenAI-compatible chunk
        chunk = {
            "id": run_id,
            "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
            "created": int(time.time()),
            "model": model,
            "choices": [
                {
                    "index": 0,
                    "delta": {},
                    "finish_reason": None,
                }
            ],
        }

        # Include the role in the first chunk
        if first_chunk:
            chunk["choices"][0]["delta"]["role"] = "assistant"
            first_chunk = False

        # Add new text to the delta if any
        if new_text:
            chunk["choices"][0]["delta"]["content"] = new_text

        # Capture a finish reason if it's provided
        finish_reason = prompt_output[0].finish_reason or None
        if finish_reason and finish_reason != "none":
            chunk["choices"][0]["finish_reason"] = finish_reason

        yield f"data: {json.dumps(chunk)}\n\n"

    # Send the final [DONE] message
    yield "data: [DONE]\n\n"
```

Make sure to add your HuggingFace token to your Secrets on Cerebrium as `HF_TOKEN`.

The run `cerebrium deploy` to make it live - you should see it live in your Cerebrium dashboard. We will use your deployment url in the next step.

Based on your GPU hardware and replica-concurrency in your cerebrium.toml, you can set how many concurrent calls the LLM can take.

### Pipecat setup

In your IDE, run the following command to create our pipecat-agent: `cerebrium init pipecat-agent`. We will be using the [Pipecat framework](https://docs.pipecat.ai/getting-started/overview) to orchestrate our services to create a voice agent

Add the following pip packages to your `cerebrium.toml` to create your deployment environment:

```
[cerebrium.deployment]
# This file was automatically generated by Cerebrium as a starting point for your project.
# You can edit it as you wish.
# If you would like to learn more about your Cerebrium config, please visit https://docs.cerebrium.ai/cerebrium/environments/config-files#config-file-example

[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "pipecat-agent"
python_version = "3.11"
include = ["./*", "main.py", "cerebrium.toml"]
exclude = ["./example_exclude"]

[cerebrium.hardware]
region = "us-east-1"
provider = "aws"
compute = "CPU"
cpu = 6
memory = 12.0

[cerebrium.scaling]
min_replicas = 1 # Note: This incurs a constant cost since at least one instance is always running.
max_replicas = 2
cooldown = 180

[cerebrium.dependencies.pip]
torch = ">=2.0.0"
"pipecat-ai[silero, daily, openai, deepgram, cartesia]" = "==0.0.67"
aiohttp = ">=3.9.4"
torchaudio = ">=2.3.0"
channels = ">=4.0.0"
requests = "==2.32.2"
dotenv = "latest"
```

You can then add the following code to your main.py:

#     else:
#         logger.error("Failed to create room")
```

There is a lot happening above but below we will give a summary:

- We are using the WebRTC functionality from Daily to create our room which you can switch out for Twilio/Telenyx. We then have two functions to create/authenticate our meeting room - create_room() and create_token()
- For the Deepgram and LLM service, we use a local url to connect to the services within the Cerebrium cluster. We are working on making this better but for now just edit with your project key.
- For TTS, we are using the Cartesia service to showcase how versatile Pipecat is but you can use the TTS service from Deepgram too!

The Daily Python SDK provides event webhooks to trigger functionality based on events like users joining or leaving calls. Add this event handling code to the `main()` function:

This code handles these events:

- First participant joins: Bot introduces itself via a conversation message
- Additional participants join: Bot listens and responds to all participants
- Participant leaves or call ends: Bot terminates itself

Based on your CPU hardware and replica-concurrency in your cerebrium.toml, you can set how many concurrent calls this Pipecat agent can take.

Create a .env file within your pipecat-agent folder with the following set:

```
DAILY_TOKEN=
HF_TOKEN=
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
CARTESIA_API_KEY=
```

Get your Daily developer token from your profile. If you don't have an account, sign up [here](https://dashboard.daily.co/u/signup) (they offer a generous free tier). Navigate to the "developers" tab to get your API key and add it to your Cerebrium Secrets.

![Daily API Key](/images/examples/voice_agent/daily-api-key.png)

To test your voice bot locally, you uncomment that main code at the bottom and then run `python main.py`. Your code should then work

That's it! You now have a fully functioning AI bot that interacts with users through speech in ~500ms. Imagine the possibilities!

Now, let's create a user interface for the bot.

### Deploy to Cerebrium

Deploy the app to Cerebrium by running this command in your terminal: `cerebrium deploy`

We'll add these endpoints to our frontend interface.

## Connect frontend

We created a public fork of the PipeCat frontend to show you a nice demo of this application. You can clone the repo [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/web-client-ui).

Follow the instructions in the README.md and then populate the following variables in your .env.development.local

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://api.aws.us-east-1.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxx/<APP_NAME> #This is the base url of your pipecat-agent. Do not include the function names
VITE_SERVER_AUTH= #This is the JWT token you can get from the API Keys section of your Cerebrium Dashboard.
```

You can now run yarn dev and go to the URL: http://localhost:5173/ to test your application!

### Conclusion

This tutorial provides a foundation for implementing voice in your app and extending into image and vision capabilities. PipeCat is an extensible, open-source framework for building voice-enabled apps, while Cerebrium provides seamless deployment and autoscaling with pay-as-you-go compute.
