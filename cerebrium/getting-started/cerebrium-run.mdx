---

The `cerebrium run` command allows you to execute a Python script in a new container on the Cerebrium platform. This is useful for running one-off scripts or testing your code in the same environment as your deployed apps.

## Usage

```bash
cerebrium run <file> --app <app-name>
```

### Parameters

- `<file>`: The Python file you want to execute (required)
- `--app <app-name>`: The name of the app to run the file under (required)

## Example

```bash
cerebrium run start.py --app my-cere-app
```

This command will:

1. Start a new container using the configuration specified in the `my-cere-app` app
2. Execute the `start.py` file within that container
3. Stream the logs to your terminal

## Logs and Monitoring

When you run a script using the `cerebrium run` command:

- Logs are displayed in real-time in your terminal
- The same logs are also available in the Cerebrium dashboard
- The run will appear under the specified app in your dashboard

## Use Cases

- Testing scripts in the same environment as your deployed apps
- Running one-off data processing tasks
- Debugging app code in a production-like environment
- Executing maintenance scripts

<Note>
  The container started by the `cerebrium run` command will be terminated once
  the script completes execution. If you need a persistent app, use `cerebrium
  deploy` instead.
</Note>

<Note>
  The container has access to your project's persistent storage and secrets,
  just like a deployed app. This allows you to test scripts that use the same
  resources as your production environment.
