description: Tips and tricks for multi-GPU inferencing.

Multi GPU inference on cerebrium is as simple as setting the `gpu_count` parameter when deploying your Cortex model. If using Huggingface transformers, you
then just need to set the `device_map` to auto and the model will be automatically distributed across all available GPUs.

While you can select any types of GPUs for your multi-GPU deployment, if you are looking for the best performance possible, we recommend using the A100 GPUs as these are connected with NVLINK. This means that the GPUs can communicate with each other much faster than with other GPUs.

You can look at an example of a multi-gpu deployment [here](https://github.com/CerebriumAI/examples/tree/master/6-multi-gpu-inference)

# Speeding up inference

Larger models are, by nature, slower as there are more calculations to be done due to there being more parameters. However, there are a few ways to speed up inference.

The first is to use **mixed precision**. This is a technique that uses half precision floating point numbers (float16) instead of the standard float32. Since the model is smaller, it is faster to run.

If using Huggingface transformers, you can use the **Accelerate** library to prepare your model after loading in the weights. This is done with:

```python
from accelerate import Accelerator
accelerator = Accelerator()
model = accelerator.prepare(model)
```

Most transformers models also allow you to use **bettertransformers** to speed up inference. This is done with:

```python
model.to_bettertransformer()
```
