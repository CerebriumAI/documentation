title: Multi-Region Deployment
description: Deploy your apps globally across multiple regions for improved latency and data residency compliance
---

<Warning>
  Multi-region deployment is currently in **beta**. Rapid updates and
  improvements will be made over the next few months to bring full functionality
  to life. Features and configuration options may change during this period.
</Warning>

Cerebrium's multi-region deployment capability allows you to deploy your apps globally across different continents, taking advantage of co-location for reduced latency and meeting data residency requirements.

## Why Use Multi-Region Deployment

Multi-region deployment provides several key benefits for your applications:

### Reduced Latency

- **Geographic proximity**: Deploy closer to your users to minimize network latency
- **Improved response times**: Reduce round-trip time for API calls and real-time applications
- **Better user experience**: Faster inference and streaming for voice agents, LLMs, and interactive applications

### Data Residency Compliance

- **Regulatory requirements**: Meet local data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Data sovereignty**: Keep sensitive data within specific geographic boundaries
- **Compliance frameworks**: Satisfy industry-specific regulations for healthcare, finance, and government sectors

### High Availability

- **Geographic redundancy**: Distribute workloads across multiple regions for fault tolerance
- **Disaster recovery**: Maintain service availability during regional outages
- **Load distribution**: Balance traffic across regions during peak usage periods

## Available Regions

Cerebrium supports deployment across three major continents with the following regions:

### United States

- **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) - Default region
- **us-west-2** (Oregon)

### Europe

- **eu-west-1** (Ireland)
- **eu-central-1** (Frankfurt)

### Asia Pacific

- **ap-southeast-1** (Singapore)
- **ap-northeast-1** (Tokyo)

<Info>
  Additional regions are being evaluated and will be added based on user demand
  and infrastructure availability. Contact support if you need deployment in a
  specific region not currently listed.
</Info>

## Configuration

Configure your app's deployment region using the `region` parameter in the `[cerebrium.hardware]` section of your `cerebrium.toml` file:

```toml
[cerebrium.hardware]
region = "eu-west-1"
provider = "aws"
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
cpu = 2
memory = 8.0
```

### Important Considerations

<Warning>
  **Separate Deployments Required**: Each region requires a separate deployment.
  Apps deployed in one region do not automatically replicate to other regions.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Independent Storage**: Each region has its own isolated persistent storage
  volume. Data stored in `/persistent-storage` in one region is not accessible
  from other regions.
</Warning>

### Multi-Region Deployment Workflow

To deploy the same app across multiple regions:

1. **Configure for first region**:

```toml
[cerebrium.hardware]
region = "us-east-1"
# ... other configuration
```

2. **Deploy to first region**:

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

3. **Update configuration for second region**:

```toml
[cerebrium.hardware]
region = "eu-west-1"
# ... other configuration
```

4. **Deploy to second region**:

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

5. **Repeat for additional regions** as needed

## Best Practices

### Region Selection Strategy

- **Choose based on user location**: Deploy in regions closest to your primary user base
- **Consider data residency**: Ensure compliance with local data protection regulations
- **Plan for redundancy**: Deploy critical applications across multiple regions for high availability

### Performance Optimization

- **Test latency**: Measure actual response times from your target user locations
- **Monitor regional performance**: Use different regions for A/B testing performance improvements
- **Optimize for specific use cases**: Voice applications benefit most from regional proximity

### Cost Management

- **Compare regional pricing**: Factor in both compute and data transfer costs
- **Monitor usage patterns**: Scale down in regions with lower demand
- **Plan data transfer**: Minimize cross-region data movement to control costs

## Migration and Updates

When updating apps across multiple regions:

1. **Test in development region first**
2. **Deploy updates region by region** to minimize risk
3. **Monitor performance** after each regional update
4. **Maintain version consistency** across regions when possible

<Warning>
  During the beta period, some features may not be available in all regions.
  Check the dashboard or contact support for region-specific feature
  availability.
