title: "Using Private Docker Registries"
description: "Use private Docker images from Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCR, and other registries as base images for your deployments."
---

Cerebrium supports using your own private Docker images as base images for your deployments - including images from Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, or any Docker-compatible private registry. 

Our build system securely pulls your private image using the Docker credentials stored in your ~/.docker/config.json, and then builds your app on top of that image. Since these credentials are used during deployment, they should be team-accessible rather than tied to a single individual.

<Note>
  Your Docker images MUST support `linux/amd64` architecture.
  This is required for Cerebrium's build environment.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Login to Your Registry

Based on your registry, login using one of the following commands:

**Docker Hub:**

```bash
docker login
# Enter username and password/token when prompted
```

**AWS ECR:**

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
  123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

**Google Container Registry:**

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

**Generic Registry:**

```bash
docker login registry.company.com
# Enter credentials when prompted
```

### Step 2: Verify Login

Check that your credentials are saved:

```bash
cat ~/.docker/config.json | jq '.auths | keys'
```

You should see your registry URL(s) listed.

### Step 3: Configure Your Project

Edit your cerebrium.toml and enter the url of the registry image from the step 2:

```toml
[cerebrium.deployment]
name = "my-app"
python_version = "3.11"
docker_base_image_url = "your-registry.com/your-org/your-image:tag"

# Examples:
# docker_base_image_url = "mycompany/ml-base:v2.1"  # Docker Hub
# docker_base_image_url = "123456.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ml-base:latest"  # ECR
# docker_base_image_url = "gcr.io/project-id/ml-base:latest"  # GCR
```

### Step 4: Deploy

Simply run:

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

Your application should then proceed to build as normal.

## Security Notes

You might be wondering what security measures Cerebrium follows in order to keep your credentials safe - we take the following precaustions: 

1. **In Transit:** Credentials are sent over HTTPS
2. **In Storage:** Stored in DynamoDB with automatic TTL-based deletion after build completion
3. **In Logs:** Never logged or displayed (using obfuscated.String type)
4. **In Build:** Only accessible during build, then discarded
