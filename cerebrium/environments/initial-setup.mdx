description: Using config files to configure Cortex deployments easily and quickly
---

You can quickly set up a Cortex project by running the following command:

```bash
cerebrium init <<project_name>>
```

This will create a Cortex project in the specified directory with the following structure:

```
project_name/
├── main.py
└── cerebrium.toml
```

Cortex supports the use of `toml` config files to configure various aspects of your project such as hardware requirements, scaling parameters and much more.
Using config files makes it easier to keep track of your Cerebrium deployments, share them and use git versioning to show changes over time.

To deploy your model with a specific config file, you can use the `cerebrium deploy` command with the `--config-file` flag to specify the path to your config file. This can be any .toml file or a .yaml (deprecated) file. Otherwise `cerebrium deploy` will use the `cerebrium.toml` file in your directory. If you would like more information on how to use config files, please see the [Using Config Files](/cerebrium/environments/config-files) page.


<Note>
  If you are still on the legacy YAML config file format, you can convert your
  config file to a `toml` config file by answering yes to the prompt when you
  run `cerebrium deploy` as normal. This will create a `cerebrium.toml` file in
  your project directory which you can then edit as you wish. Additionally, all
  the dependencies in your `pkglist.txt` and `conda_pkglist.txt` files will be
  added to the `cerebrium.toml` file automatically
</Note>

```bash
cerebrium deploy
```

Your config file can be named anything you want and can be placed anywhere on your local machine. However, remember to use the `cerebrium deploy` command in the same directory as your main.py as you would normally.
