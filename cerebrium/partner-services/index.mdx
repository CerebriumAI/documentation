description: Deploy specialized services from Cerebrium's partners with simplified configurations
---

<Note>Partner Services are available from CLI version 1.39.0 and greater</Note>

Cerebrium offers specialized services in partnership with leading AI companies. These Partner Services feature simplified configurations, independent scaling, and quick deployment.

Currently, Cerebrium offers the following Partner Services:

- [Deepgram](/cerebrium/partner-services/deepgram) - Speech-to-text (STT) services
- [Rime](/cerebrium/partner-services/rime) - Text-to-speech (TTS) services

## Benefits of Partner Services

Partner Services provide several advantages:

- Quick and easy deployment
- Independent scaling of each service
- Reduced costs by running models on Cerebrium's optimized runtime
- Reduced latency by running models on the same network as the app
- Deploy to specific regions for data compliance and latency requirements

## Getting Started

To use Partner Services, you'll need to configure service-specific requirements through Cerebrium's platform. Each partner service has unique configuration needs - please refer to the individual service pages linked above for detailed requirements, which may include:

1. API keys and authentication details
2. Service-specific configuration parameters
3. Resource requirements and limitations

## Scaling and Concurrency

Partner Services support independent scaling configurations:

- Use the `min_replicas` and `max_replicas` parameters to control the number of instances
- The `replica_concurrency` parameter determines how many concurrent requests each instance can handle
- Adjust the `cooldown` parameter to control how long instances remain active after processing requests
- Adjust the `hardware` section to control the instance type which affects performance and/or cost
