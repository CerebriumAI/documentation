You may want to use API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in your app, but you don't want them stored in your code. In this case, it's best to use Secrets. Secrets are stored encrypted (256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) and are only decrypted when your app runs.

Secrets are shared across all apps in your project.

Adding a secret will make the value available to your app as an environment variable.

Secrets are loaded on container startup. If you update a secret, you must restart your app container for the changes to take effect.

```python
def predict(run_id):
    print(f"Run ID: {run_id}")

    hf_token = os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN")
    logger.info(f"HF_TOKEN: {hf_token}")

    return {"result": f"Your HF_TOKEN is {hf_token}"}
```

<Note>
  Secrets are stored as strings. If your secret is a JSON payload or similar,
  remember to convert it to the correct format using
  `json.loads(os.environ.get("MY_JSON_SECRET"))`.
</Note>

### Managing Secrets

Secrets are created, updated, and deleted in your dashboard.

<Note>
  Secrets are loaded on model start. You will need to wait for your app
  container to restart or deploy your app before the new secret is available.
</Note>

### Automatic Environment Variables

In addition to your secrets, Cerebrium automatically sets the following environment variables for your deployments:

- APP_NAME: The name of your application
- HF_HOME: Set to '/persistent-storage/.cache/huggingface' for caching HuggingFace models
- PROJECT_ID: The ID of your Cerebrium project
- BUILD_ID: The unique identifier for the current build

<Note>The app_id is a composite of PROJECT_ID + '_' + APP_NAME.</Note>

### Local Development

When developing locally, you can use an `.env` file to store your secrets. Later, you can add these secrets to your project from the dashboard.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

hf_token = os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN")
```
