title: Job Config Files
description: Using config files to configure Cortex Jobs easily and quickly
---

To keep your development experience as efficient as possible, we've kept the config files for Cerebrium `Jobs` in the same familiar format as those for `Cortex` deployments.

## Using Config Files

To add your config file to a `Job`, you can use the `cortex job` command with the `--config-file` flag to specify the path to your config file.

```bash
cerebrium job --config-file your_config_file.yaml
```

For simplicity, you can use the same config file from a `Cortex` deployment and we'll ignore the unused parameters that govern model scaling.

### Config File Format and Parameters  
For your convenience, we've tabulated the parameters for your config file below:


| Parameter           | Description                                   | Type    | Default                                                            |

| `include`           | Files to include in the deployment            | string  | '[./*, main.py, requirements.txt, pkglist.txt, conda_pkglist.txt]' |
| `exclude`           | Files to exclude from the deployment          | string  | '[./.*, ./__*]'                                                    |
