title: Calculating your cost
description: How to calculate the cost of your deployment on Cerebrium

The cost of your deployment is based on the hardware you select and the amount of time you use it for.
GPU, CPU and Memory usage are all charged per second while persistent storage is charged per GB per month.

Here's an example of how you can calculate the cost of your deployment:

- Suppose you want to deploy a model that takes 2 seconds to run and you want to run it 1000 times.
- For this model, you choose a GPU with the required amount of memory and 2 CPU cores.
- Additionally, you require 20GB of RAM and use 10GB of persistent storage.

Now let's say your app has been deployed for 1 month.  
Your company is growing, you have some traction and you're getting 100 000 requests per month.

```python
# Your variables
average_inference_time = 3 # seconds
number_of_inferences = 100000 # number of inferences per month



# Cost of the hardware
GPU_cost = 0.000356 # $ per second
CPU_cost = 0.000001 # $ per second
memory_cost = 0.0000065972 # $ per second
persistant_storage_cost = 0.23 # $ per GB per month

gb_of_persistent_storage = 10
gb_of_RAM = 20
num_of_cpu_cores = 2

# cost calculation
total_inference_time = average_inference_time * number_of_inferences
compute_cost = (GPU_cost + CPU_cost*num_of_cpu_cores + memory_cost*gb_of_RAM ) * total_inference_time
storage_cost = gb_of_persistent_storage * persistant_storage_cost

total_cost = compute_cost + storage_cost


print(f"Compute cost: ${compute_cost :.2f}/month",
      f"\nStorage cost: ${storage_cost :.2f}/month",
      f"\nTotal cost: ${total_cost :.2f}/month")
```

From this, you can see that the cost of your deployment is:

```bash
Compute cost: $146.98/month
Storage cost: $2.30/month
Total cost: $149.28/month
```

Now you would expect the cost to grow linearly with the number of requests you get however, we want to help you grow your business and so we are happy to discount your computing cost as you grow.
To see the discounts you can get for your volume, check out our pricing page or contact us directly.

As you grow, don't worry about scaling your deployment with demand, sourcing new hardware or managing your infrastructure.  
You can focus on your code and we'll handle the rest.
