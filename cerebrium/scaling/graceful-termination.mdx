title: "Graceful Termination"
description: "Handle instance shutdown to prevent 502 errors during scaling"
---

Cerebrium terminates instances during scaling and redeployments. Proper graceful termination ensures active requests complete successfully rather than failing with 502 errors.

## How Termination Works

When Cerebrium needs to terminate an instance:

1. Stops routing new requests to the instance
2. Sends SIGTERM signal to your application
3. Waits for `response_grace_period` seconds
4. Sends SIGKILL if the instance has not stopped

## Configuration

Configure the grace period in your `cerebrium.toml` file:
```toml
[cerebrium.scaling]
response_grace_period = 300  # Seconds to wait before force termination

<Warning>
Without `response_grace_period`, instances are force-killed immediately, causing 502 errors.
</Warning>

Set to 1.5x your maximum expected request duration.

Runtime Behavior
Cortex Runtime (Default): SIGTERM handled automatically. Just configure response_grace_period.
Custom Runtime: You must handle SIGTERM in your application code.
