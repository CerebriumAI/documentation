GPT4All is a 7B param language model that is fine tuned from a curated set of 400k GPT-Turbo-3.5 assistant-style generation. - you can read more [here](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all). In order to deploy it you can use the identifier below:

- GPT4All: `gpt4-all`

Here's an example of how to call the deployed endpoint:

      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "prompt": "Tell me a story of a tortoise",
        "num_beams": 2,
        "min_new_tokens": 10,
        "max_length": 100,
        "repetition_penalty": 2.0
    }'
```
</RequestExample>

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  This is the Cerebrium API key used to authenticate your request. You can get
  it from your Cerebrium dashboard.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
  The prompt you would like GPT4ALL to process.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="num_beams" type="string" optional>
  The larger the beam size the higher the likelihood of finding a better solution but it also increases the computational complexity and inference time.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="min_new_tokens" type="string" optional>
  The minimum number of tokens the model must generate. The 
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_length" type="string" optional>
  The maximum number of tokens the model must generate. The default is 100.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="repetition_penalty" type="string" required>
  parameter used in text generation to penalize repeated words or tokens in the generated text. This is a number greater than or equal to 1.
</ParamField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
