In this tutorial, we'll create a high-throughput, low-latency REST API for serving text-embeddings, reranking models, clip, clap and colpali. We will be using the open-source framework
[infinity](https://github.com/michaelfeil/infinity/tree/main).

### Project Setup

Make sure you have completed our [quickstart]() to make sure you have our CLI installed and have created an account.

1. Run the command, `cerebrium init infinity-throughput`

It would have created two files:
- main.py: Where are entrypoint code lives
- Cerebrium.toml: Where we define our container image and auto-scaling parameters
