quickly build an ML product."

Our goal is to help companies create value through machine learning as quickly and as painlessly as possible by abstracting away a lot of the complexity and mundane infrastructure setup.

Sagemaker is feature rich, so we are developing the most requested functionality
weekly based on your feedback. You can send us feedback requests at
[support@cerebrium.ai](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai)

## How we do this

- <b>
    <u>Infrastructure</u>
  </b>
  We abstract away all of the complexity around infrastructure so you don't have
  to worry about CPUs/GPUs, Kubernetes, queues, monitoring, scaling etc. We take
  care of this to create a robust and seamless developer experience.
- <b>
    <u>Research</u>
  </b>
  We try to implement the latest research towards your model as best we can in
  order for you to deliver the best experience to your users. We automatically implement
  quantization, LoRA, pruning and many more techniques to get your model to run faster
  and cheaper without sacrificing performance.

## Our users favorite features

- \<30 second cold-start times
- Wide variety of GPUs
- Automatic scaling from 1 to 10k requests in \<15s
- Define pip/conda container environments
