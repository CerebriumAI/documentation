# App Scaling

Apps on Cerebrium are scaled up and down automatically based on the number of requests the App is receiving. This mechanism ensures that idle resources are not being paid for and that the app is always available to serve requests. There are several parameters that regulate the scaling of an app:
• minReplicas: The minimum number of replicas allowed for the app. Set to 0 for serverless apps. For latency-sensitive Apps, this can be set to a higher number to skip scale-up time and keep servers running; however, runtime charges will apply. Defaults to 0.
• maxReplicas: The maximum number of replicas allowed for the app. Useful for cost-sensitive Apps when limiting the number of replicas is necessary. By default, this is not set, and the model scales to fit the volume of requests.
• cooldown: The cooldown period in seconds is the period of inactivity before the number of replicas for the app is scaled down by one. Defaults to 60 seconds.
• responseGracePeriod: The amount of time in seconds the app has to respond to a request or gracefully terminate on a scale-down SIGTERM signal.

While these parameters are set at build time, they can be changed at any time using the Cerebrium CLI. To modify the scaling parameters for an app, run the following command:

```bash
cerebrium app scale <app_id> \
--cooldown <SECONDS> \
--min-replicas <INTEGER> \
--max-replicas <INTEGER> \
--response-grace-period <SECONDS>
```

Each of the parameters is optional, and current values are preserved if they are not specified.

Updating App Scaling Using a REST Endpoint

To update the scaling parameters via a REST endpoint, the following endpoint can be used:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://rest.cerebrium.ai/v2/projects/{project_id}/apps/{app_id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "minReplicaCount": 0,
    "maxReplicaCount": 1,
    "cooldownPeriodSeconds": 180,
    "responseGracePeriodSeconds": 30,
    "cpu": 4,
    "gpuCount": 1,
    "compute": "CPU",
    "memory": 8
}'
```

Replace the values for minReplicaCount, maxReplicaCount, cooldownPeriodSeconds, and responseGracePeriodSeconds with the desired values. All values are optional; if a parameter does not need to be updated, it can be omitted from the request body. Ensure that the app_id matches the ID of the App when it was deployed.

Upon success, the following confirmation response is sent:

```bash
{
"message": "✅ App scaling updated successfully"
}
```
