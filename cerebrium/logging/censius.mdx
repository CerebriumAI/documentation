# Setup
Sign up for a free account [here](https://console.censius.ai/signup). 
If you wish, consult the [Censius documentation](https://documentation.censius.ai/) for more information on how to set up Censius to your liking.
Once you have signed up for Censius, you will need to create a new project. 
You can do this by clicking on the <b>New Project</b> button on the top right corner of the screen.
You should note the <b>Project ID</b> as you will need it later.

You will need to register a dataset with Censius which is associated with your model.
The dataset contains information about the data used to train your model, including the feature names and targets.
Note your dataset *must* contain a timestamp column. This is used to track the performance of your model over time.
Instantiate a Censius Client within your notebook or file and register a dataset in the project you previously created:

```python
from censius import CensiusClient, DatasetType

api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
tenant_id = "<YOUR_TENANT_ID>"
client = CensiusClient(api_key=api_key, tenant_id=tenant_id)

df = pd.read_csv("SOME_CSV_FILE.csv")
client.register_dataset(
    name="<DATASET_NAME>",
    file=df,
    project_id=<PROJECT_ID>,
    features= [
        {"name": "feature_1", "type": DatasetType.DECIMAL},
        {"name": "feature_2", "type": DatasetType.DECIMAL},
        {"name": "target", "type": DatasetType.INT}
    ],
    timestamp={"name": "Timestamp", "type": DatasetType.UNIX_S}
)
```

This should return a dataset ID which you use to add a Censius logger to your Conduit object.

# Adding a Censius Logger
Once you have instantiated your Conduit object in code (see [here](/cerebrium/test-and-deploy)), you can add a Censius logger to it by calling the `add_logger` method.
The <b>Censius</b> logger requires the following platform specific arguments:
- `project_id`: The ID of the project you created in Censius.
- `model_type`: The type of <i>Censius</i> model you are using. This can be either `censius.ModelType.BINARY_CLASSIFICATION` or `censius.ModelType.REGRESSION`.
- `training_info`: A dictionary containing the Censius Dataset information. This should contain the following keys:
    - `id`: The ID of the dataset you registered with Censius.
    - `method`: Always `censius.Dataset.ID`

```python
from cerebrium import Conduit, model_type, logging_platform
from censius import Dataset, ModelType
conduit = Conduit(...)

platform_args = {
    "project_id": <PROJECT_ID>,
    "model_type": ModelType.BINARY_CLASSIFICATION,
    "training_info": {
        "id": <DATASET_ID>,
        "method": Dataset.ID
    }
}

conduit.add_logger(
    lplatform=logging_platform.CENSIUS, 
    platform_authentication={"api_key": "<CENSIUS_API_KEY>", "tenant_id": "<CENSIUS_TENANT_ID>"},
    features=["feature_1", "feature_2", "feature_3"],
    targets=["target"],
    platform_args=platform_args,
    log_ms=True
)
```

You can now deploy your Conduit as normal! Your model will log predictions to Censius every time you call the endpoint.
```
conduit.deploy()
```
