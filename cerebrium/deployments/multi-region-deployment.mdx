title: Multi-Region Deployment
description: Deploy your apps globally across multiple regions for improved latency and data residency compliance
---

Cerebrium's multi-region deployment capability allows you to deploy your apps globally across different continents, taking advantage of co-location for reduced latency and meeting data residency requirements.

<Warning>
  Multi-region deployment is currently in **beta**. Rapid updates and
  improvements will be made over the next few months to bring full functionality
  to life. Please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ATj6USmeE2)
  about features/functionality you would like to see
</Warning>

## Why Use Multi-Region Deployment

- **Reduced Latency**: Deploy closer to users for faster response times and better experience with real-time applications like voice agents and LLMs
- **Data Residency**: Meet data protection requirements by keeping sensitive data within specific geographic regions to comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA
- **High Availability**: Ensure fault tolerance and continuous service through geographic redundancy, disaster recovery, and load balancing across multiple regions

## Available Regions

Cerebrium supports deployment across three major continents with the following regions:

### United States

- **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) - Default region

### Europe

- **eu-west-2** (United Kingdon)

### Asia Pacific

- **ap-south-1** (India)

<Info>
  Additional regions are being evaluated and will be added based on user demand
  and infrastructure availability. Contact
  [support](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) if you need deployment in a specific
  region not currently listed.

## CLI Configuration

You can configure your CLI to work with different regions in two ways:

Set a default region for your CLI sessions that will be used for all commands:

```bash
cerebrium region set us-east-1
```

This will set the default region for commands like listing storage volumes, running applications, and other operations.

Alternatively, you can specify the region for individual commands using the `--region` flag:

```bash
# List storage volumes in a specific region
cerebrium ls --region eu-west-2

```

<Info>
  The `--region` flag takes precedence over the default region set with `cerebrium region set`. This allows you to temporarily use a different region without changing your default configuration.
</Info>

## App Deployment

Configure your app's deployment region using the `region` parameter in the `[cerebrium.hardware]` section of your `cerebrium.toml` file:

```toml
[cerebrium.hardware]
region = "us-east-1"
provider = "aws"
compute = "AMPERE_A10"
cpu = 2
memory = 8.0
```

## Pricing

Pricing varies by region based on local infrastructure costs and availability:

## GPU Availability by Region

GPU availability and pricing vary across regions due to infrastructure constraints and local demand:

| GPU Model        | US East | EU West | AP South |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| HOPPER_H100      | ✅      | ✅      | ✅       |
| AMPERE_A100_40GB | ✅      | ✅      | ✅       |
| ADA_L40S         | ✅      | ❌      | ❌       |
| ADA_L4           | ✅      | ✅      | ✅       |
| AMPERE_A10       | ✅      | ✅      | ✅       |
| TURING_T4        | ✅      | ✅      | ✅       |

### Limitations

- Each region requires a separate deployment. Apps deployed in one region do not automatically replicate to other regions.
- Each region has its own isolated persistent storage volume. Data stored in `/persistent-storage` in one region is not accessible
  from other regions.
