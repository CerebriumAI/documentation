title: "Model Status"
description: "Know your model's current state for efficient deployment and management"

Your Cortex model can be in one of several states at any given time.

Here's what each status represents:

- **Active**: The model is successfully deployed and available for use. If your model is sourced from a pre-built setup, it will immediately be in the active state.

- **Cold**: This state indicates that your model is ready and can be called but will take a few seconds to start up.

- **Deploying**: The model is currently in the process of being deployed. During this state, your model is not available for use.

- **Starting**: Your model has been built and is now starting up, none of the replicas are ready yet but should be soon.

- **Deleted**: This status signifies that there is no deployment associated with the model, which usually means the model has been removed.

- **Unknown**: This state is assigned when the model's status cannot be determined, which could be due to an issue with retrieving deployment details.

<Note>
  Remember, the deployment and startup time is proportional to the model size
  (including dependencies). For lightning-fast deployments, start-ups, and
  scale-ups, keep your model as small as possible!
</Note>

When you navigate to your Cerebrium dashboard and click on the Models tab,
you will be able to see the current state of your models.
