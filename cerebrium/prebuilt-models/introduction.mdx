title: "Deploying Prebuilt Models"
description: "Cerebrium provides prebuilt models that you can deploy to an API seamlessly"
---

Cerebrium and its community keep a library of popular pre-built models that you can deploy using one click or one line of code. If you would like any pre-built models added you can:
- Post a [bounty](https://www.cerebrium.ai/bounties) for our community to create it
- [Contact](mailto:support@cerebrium.ai) the Cerebrium team and we will see what we can do

You can deploy prebuilt models via Cerebrium using two methods.

<ol>
  <li>Doing simple one-click deploys from your dashboard by navigating to the <b>Prebuilt tab</b></li>
  <li>Through our Python framework. </li>
</ol>
Deploying a prebuilt model through our framework is largely similar to deploying
a custom model. The only difference is that you do not need to upload a model file.
Instead, you specify which prebuilt model you want to deploy using the corresponding
identifier.

```bash Install Cerebrium package
pip install --upgrade cerebrium
```

```python Deploy a prebuilt Whisper Model
from cerebrium import deploy, model_type
endpoint = deploy((model_type.PREBUILT, "whisper-medium"), 'my-flow', "<API_KEY>")
```

<Note>
  You can not use prebuilt models in ensembles or with processing functions.
  They should be contained within single-model flows only.
</Note>

You can check out the available models through your dashboard or by reading our docs below
