title: "Asynchronous Execution"
description: "Execute calls to a Cerebrium app to be run asynchronously"

<Note>
This is a new feature! As such, the API is still currently subject to changes.

However, should you encounter an issue please reach out to us on Discord!

</Note>

Many applications require asynchronous execution of functions in a "fire-and-forget" fashion
in order to work optimally. In this scenario, you hand off execution of a function to be Cerebrium's
responsibility, while you as the developer are responsible for ensuring that data is able leave the function.

You can enable your function to execute asynchronously by adding the `async` query parameter to your request
, and setting it to `true`. This would look something like this:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/<YOUR-APP>/run?async=true'\
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-JWT-TOKEN>\
       --data '{"param": "hello world"}'
```

This would _immediately_ return a response akin to the following, with a body that only specifies a `run_id`:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Connection: close
Content-Length: 50
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2024 03:13:25 GMT
Server: envoy
Vary: Origin
X-Envoy-Upstream-Service-Time: 2
X-Request-Id: 21eb3b98-4b10-9ad6-8681-a47172828024

{"run_id":"21eb3b98-4b10-9ad6-8681-a47172828024"}
```

In the background, Cerebrium will now run this HTTP request for you.
Your function is still expected to behave in a **synchronous** manner. That is, it must open a connection, keep
it open while it is doing work, then return a response once it is done. This effectively allows you
to treat a synchronous request-responses as asynchronous, and you can do anything within the scope
of your function call with a _12 hour timeout_. This does **not** mean your actual Python function cannot be `async`.
Rather, this means that the lifetime of the function is still tied to lifetime of the request made to your app.
If you terminate your function early and return a response while the application is still doing work, the Cerebrium
system will begin to terminate the application. Therefore, you should only return a response once the container
has finished processing the task, and not earlier.

In order to use async execution effectively, you must ensure that your function exports any relevant data you
need, since you will no longer be able to receive a request. An easy way to achieve this would be to combine
async execution with a specified `webhookEndpoint`, to have Cerebrium automatically forward the body of
the function response once it has returned:

```bash
curl -X POST <https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/><YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/<YOUR-APP>/run?async=true&webhookEndpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fwebhook.site%2F'\
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-JWT-TOKEN>\
 --data '{"param": "hello world"}'
```

As with webhooks, this a feature of our proxy, and you will not need to modify any part of your code in order to use the webhook
functionality. In your dashboard, your function will be marked as **async**, but will still show the status of the internal synchronous call
that was made (in other words, if the call to your function failed, the state of your async request would be `failure` etc.)
